Content Distribution Engine (CDE)

1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical data definitions (DATADEF) for the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
It provides:
field-level semantic meaning
invariants and constraints
cross-engine contract expectations
authoritative reference for audits and integrations
This document complements NS-CDE-007 — DATAMODEL and completes the CDE documentation set.
2. DATADEF Principles
Semantic Stability — field meaning never changes
Immutability by Default — history is preserved via new records
Proof-Based Truth — delivery success requires evidence
Governed Mutation — high-impact changes require approval context
Cross-Engine Clarity — shared fields have single meaning
3. Content Artifact Definitions
3.1 content_artifact
Field
Definition
Notes
content_id
Canonical content identifier
Stable UUID
content_type
Content classification

11. Cross-Engine Contract Expectations
Engine
CDE Contract
PIE
Provides content artifacts
DRE
Provides research artifacts
GGP
Governs plan approval
MUX
Executes channel adapters
SIG
Aggregates feedback signals
DAT
Consumes outcome metrics
IDN
Resolves actor/entity identity
CWP
Schedules and supervises execution
12. Validation & Constraints
all timestamps are UTC
all IDs are UUIDs
proofs required for success
idempotency keys enforced per attempt
13. Backward Compatibility Rules
fields may be added, never removed
field meaning never changes
deprecated fields remain readable

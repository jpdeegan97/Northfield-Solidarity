Content Distribution Engine (CDE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the optional frontend (FE) / operator UI for the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
The CDE Operator UI exists to:
  draft and submit distribution plans
  view approval status and governance references
  monitor execution fan-out, retries, and failures
  inspect delivery proofs and reconcile issues
  review feedback signals and route anomalies
  export audit packs
CDE FE is an execution visibility + control surface with governed controls.
2. FE Design Principles
 Plan First — operators primarily create and manage plans
 Governance-Aware — approval state is visible everywhere
 Execution Transparency — fan-out attempts are inspectable
 Idempotency Clarity — retries and dedupe are explicit
 Proof Over Assumption — success requires proof artifacts
3. Primary Personas
  Operator — creates plans, monitors execution, resolves failures
  Governance Reviewer — verifies approvals and policy compliance
  Auditor — exports proofs and timelines
  Ops Engineer — investigates incidents and performance
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Dashboard
Purpose: at-a-glance state.
Widgets:
  recent plans (draft/approved/executing)
  failure rate by destination
  retry backlog
  DLQ queue size
4.2 Content Artifact Browser
Purpose: select content for distribution.
Features:
  search by content_id, type, source_engine
  content version history (reference)
  preview metadata and attachments (if available)
4.3 Plan Builder
Purpose: create and edit plan drafts.
Sections:
  content selection
  destination selection (channel + destination)
  schedule (immediate/deferred/recurring)
  constraints and policy notes
  actor + reason
Actions:
  save draft
  validate draft
  submit for approval
4.4 Plan Detail
Purpose: view plan lifecycle.
Displays:
  plan_id, plan_version
  status (draft/approved/rejected/archived)
  governance_ref (if approved)
  plan items (content × destinations)
  schedule window
Actions:
  clone plan (new version)
  cancel scheduled execution (guarded)
4.5 Approval Timeline
Purpose: governance visibility.
Displays:
  submission metadata
  approval/rejection rationale
  governance reference
4.6 Execution Monitor (Intent + Fan-Out)
Purpose: see intents and attempts.
Views:
  intent list for plan
  attempt grid by destination
Attempt fields:
  status
  retry_count
  last error
  adapter version
  correlation_id
Actions:
  re-run attempt (idempotent, guarded)
  pause plan execution (if supported)
4.7 Attempt Detail
Purpose: deep drill-down.
Displays:
  request envelope
  adapter response
  decision artifacts (retry classification)
  proof status
Actions:
  manual reconcile (attach proof)
  escalate to incident
4.8 Proof & Reconciliation
Purpose: verify delivery.
Displays:
  proofs by attempt
  mismatches (success without proof blocked)
  reconciliation status
Actions:
  mark proof insufficient (forces review)
4.9 Feedback Viewer
Purpose: monitor post-distribution outcomes.
Displays:
  impressions/clicks/conversions
  rejection notices
  anomaly flags
Actions:
  forward flagged issues to operator queue
  export as SIG-ready signal bundle
4.10 DLQ / Failure Queue
Purpose: manage exhausted retries.
Displays:
  failed attempts with reason
  retry history
  last adapter response
Actions:
  reopen attempt (guarded)
  open merge with governance review (if policy issue)
  mark non-actionable
4.11 Audit Pack Export
Purpose: generate evidence bundles.
Export options:
  plan-level audit pack
  destination-level audit pack
Includes:
  plan + approval
  all intents/attempts
  proofs
  decision artifacts
  correlation IDs
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
  ContentSearchBar
  ContentArtifactTable
  PlanBuilderWizard
  DestinationPicker
  SchedulePicker
  ConstraintsEditor
  GovernedActionModal (actor + reason + governance_ref when needed)
  PlanStatusBadge
  AttemptGrid
  AttemptDetailPanel
  ProofList
  FeedbackChartPanel
  DLQQueueTable
  AuditPackExporter
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
Read:
  list/search content artifacts
  list plans, get plan detail
  approval status and rationale
  list intents, list attempts
  attempt detail (errors, decisions, proofs)
  feedback signals
  DLQ queue
Write (guarded):
  create/update plan drafts
  submit plan for approval
  clone plan (new version)
  trigger rerun attempt (idempotent)
  attach proof / reconcile
7. Non-Functional Requirements
  strong filtering/search for plans and attempts
  near-real-time execution status updates (polling or websocket)
  strict RBAC on governed actions
  exportable audit packs

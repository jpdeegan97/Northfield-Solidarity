Content Distribution Engine (CDE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the end-to-end lifecycle of content distribution within the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
It describes how content moves from:
upstream surety and approval
into executable distribution intents
through channel execution
into proof, feedback, and audit artifacts
The lifecycle is designed to be governed, deterministic, observable, and replayable.
2. Lifecycle Design Principles
No Distribution Without Approval
Intent Before Execution
Execution Is Idempotent
Failures Are First-Class Outcomes
All State Transitions Are Recorded
3. High-Level Lifecycle Phases
Content Availability
Distribution Plan Creation
Governance Review & Approval
Intent Materialization
Execution Attempt(s)
Delivery Proof Capture
Feedback Ingestion
Audit & Replay
4. Phase 1 — Content Availability
Trigger:
PIE or DRE produces a content artifact
External content is registered
CDE Actions:
validate content reference
store metadata pointer
No distribution occurs at this phase.
5. Phase 2 — Distribution Plan Creation
Trigger:
Operator or upstream engine proposes distribution
Artifacts Created:
Distribution Plan (immutable draft)
Checks:
valid content references
valid channels and destinations
scheduling parameters
6. Phase 3 — Governance Review & Approval
Trigger:
Plan submitted for approval
Governance (GGP):
validate authority and scope
enforce policies (timing, content class, channel)
Outcomes:
approved
rejected
returned for modification
Only approved plans advance.
7. Phase 4 — Intent Materialization
Trigger:
approved plan reaches execution time
Artifacts Created:
Distribution Intent
Actions:
expand plan into per-destination intents
bind actor and context
Intents are immutable.
8. Phase 5 — Execution Attempts
Trigger:
intent scheduled for execution
Actions:
dispatcher creates execution attempt
call MUX adapter
Attempt States:
pending
running
success
failed
retried
Retries respect idempotency.
9. Phase 6 — Delivery Proof Capture
Trigger:
successful execution
Artifacts:
delivery proof
Proofs include:
external IDs
URLs
receipts
Proofs are immutable.
10. Phase 7 — Feedback Ingestion
Trigger:
platform emits performance or status data
Actions:
normalize feedback
persist signal
forward to SIG
Feedback does not mutate proofs.
11. Phase 8 — Audit & Replay
Capabilities:
reconstruct who approved what
replay execution attempts
verify idempotency and outcomes
Replay does not alter historical state.
12. Failure & Exception Paths
Governance Failure
plan blocked
no intents created
Execution Failure
attempt marked failed
retry scheduled or escalated
Channel Failure
adapter error normalized
surfaced to operator
13. Lifecycle Invariants
Plans are immutable after approval
Intents cannot be edited
Attempts are append-only
Proofs cannot be altered

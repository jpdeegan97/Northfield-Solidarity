GGE Version Semantics & Propagation Rules Specification v0.1
Overview
Document Title: Governance Graph Engine – Version Semantics & Propagation Rules 
Document ID: NS-GGP-060-VERSION
Version: 0.1 
Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: As Needed / Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
This specification defines the rules and semantics governing how SOP and component versions are incremented and how changes propagate across dependent SOPs within the Governance Graph Engine (GGE).
Objectives:
  Ensure deterministic versioning
  Maintain auditability
  Avoid silent or untracked changes
  Provide clear rationale for major, minor, or patch bumps
  Control propagation of changes across interdependent SOPs
2. Versioning Philosophy
  Atomic Versioning: Components and SOPs are versioned independently
  Deterministic Propagation: Dependency graph dictates which SOPs must update
  Immutable Published Versions: No modification to published SOPs
  Human Oversight: Advisory suggestions exist, but approvals are required
Version Components
  Major: Material change affecting multiple SOPs, high-risk impact, or compliance-triggered
  Minor: Moderate change affecting one SOP or non-critical component updates
  Patch: Minor wording, typo corrections, or non-impactful metadata changes
Version Format
  Semantic: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.3.1)
  Optional pre-release or draft tag if under review
3. Trigger Events for Version Changes
 Component Update
  Add / Modify / Deprecate
  Impacts SOPs in dependency graph
 SOP Content Change
  Manual revision post-review
 Authority or Materiality Change
  Changes propagate to SOPs referencing affected components
 Risk & Compliance Event
  Requires SOP version update if risk thresholds are crossed
4. Propagation Rules
4.1 Dependency Graph Traversal
  Identify direct and indirect SOP dependencies
  Determine change impact severity (Major / Minor / Patch)
  Flag SOPs for update according to dependency depth
4.2 Propagation Logic
 Major Change:
  All dependent SOPs must receive at least a minor bump
  High-risk SOPs flagged for mandatory review
 Minor Change:
  Directly impacted SOP receives minor bump
  Indirect SOPs reviewed for necessity of patch bump
 Patch Change:
  Limited to single SOP
  No propagation unless explicitly required
4.3 Escalation
  If multiple SOPs cross materiality thresholds simultaneously, escalate to senior approver
  Automatically record reason in audit trail
5. Version Update Workflow
 Detect component or SOP change
 Execute Dependency Graph Traversal
 Determine proposed SOP version bumps
 Feed to Update Decision Prompt (UDP) for advisory
 Collect approvals
 Apply updates and record in audit trail
 Publish new SOP versions
6. Audit Requirements
  All version changes logged with:
  Execution ID
  Trigger type
  Component / SOP IDs
  Previous and new version
  Rationale (generated by UDP)
  Approver metadata
  Version history maintained per SOP
  No silent overwrites permitted
7. Non-Goals
  Versioning outside GGE
  Automatic human approval
  External system enforcement
8. Version Control

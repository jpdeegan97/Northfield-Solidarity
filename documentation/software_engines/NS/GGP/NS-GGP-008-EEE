Document Title: Governance Graph Engine – End-to-End Example Execution 
Document ID: NS-GGP-EEE-008

Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: As Needed / Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
This document provides a step-by-step example of how a governance change flows through the GGE system. It illustrates the interaction of all core components including:
  Component Taxonomy
  Update Decision Prompt (UDP)
  Version Semantics & Propagation Rules
  Audit Data Model
  SOP compilation
  Frontend read models
The goal is to validate design logic, identify potential gaps, and ensure auditability.
2. Scenario Overview
Scenario: Materiality threshold change for a financial component affecting multiple SOPs.
Trigger: Manual update of the materiality threshold for Capital Flow SOP component.
Affected SOPs:
 Capital Flow SOP
 Intercompany Transactions SOP
 Finance / Cash Flow SOP
Goal: Update impacted SOPs, ensure proper version bumps, record audit trail, and visualize results in the frontend.
3. Step-by-Step Execution
Step 1: Component Change Event
  Executor: Finance Manager
  Component: Capital Flow Materiality Threshold
  Change Type: Modify
  Previous Value: $50,000
  New Value: $100,000
  Materiality Classification: Medium → High
GGE Action:
  Assign Execution ID: EXEC-2025-001
  Capture execution context
Step 2: Dependency Graph Resolution
  Identify SOPs impacted by this component
  Determine depth of dependencies
  Classify impact (Major/Minor/Patch)
Impact Assessment:
  Capital Flow SOP → Major
  Intercompany Transactions SOP → Minor
  Finance / Cash Flow SOP → Minor
Step 3: Update Decision Prompt (UDP) Execution
  Input: Component delta + dependency map + governance constraints
  Reasoning Tasks:
  Classify impact
  Recommend SOP version bumps
  Suggest update order
  Flag risk/compliance
  Recommend approval routing
UDP Output (JSON structured):
{
  "execution_id": "EXEC-2025-001",
  "sop_update_recommendations": [
    {"sop_id": "CFS-001", "version": "2.0.0", "change_type": "Major"},
    {"sop_id": "ICT-001", "version": "1.1.0", "change_type": "Minor"},
    {"sop_id": "FCF-001", "version": "1.1.0", "change_type": "Minor"}
  ],
  "update_order": ["CFS-001", "ICT-001", "FCF-001"],
  "risk_flags": [{"sop_id": "CFS-001", "severity": "High"}],
  "approval_suggestions": ["Finance Director", "Compliance Officer"]
}
Step 4: Approval Workflow
  Notifications sent to Finance Director and Compliance Officer
  Collect approvals
  Update execution state: Pending Approval → Approved
Step 5: SOP Compilation
  Apply approved changes
  Generate new SOP versions:
  Capital Flow SOP: v2.0.0
  Intercompany Transactions SOP: v1.1.0
  Finance / Cash Flow SOP: v1.1.0
  Update metadata and references
Step 6: Audit Recording
  Record all changes in gge_executions, gge\_component\_changes, and gge\_sop\_versions
  Immutable logs created for each SOP and component change
  Execution state: Published → Closed
Step 7: Frontend Visualization
Execution Audit Trail Screen:
  Displays execution ID, trigger type, executor, timestamp
  Component changes with previous and new versions
  SOP versions with change type and approvals
SOP Version History Screen:
  Lists all published SOP versions per SOP
  Allows click-through to view full SOP PDF/HTML
  Shows dependencies visually (optional)
4. Key Observations
  Version propagation and sequencing works as designed
  UDP correctly flags risk and recommends approval routing
  Audit trail is fully populated and immutable
  Frontend screens can render execution and SOP history with minimal query complexity
5. Next Steps
 Validate real-world scenarios across all SOPs
 Stress test multiple simultaneous component updates
 Implement FE MVP for audit trail and SOP version screens
 Integrate automated notifications for approvals

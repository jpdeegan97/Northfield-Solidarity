GGE Architecture & Design Document
Overview
System Name: Governance Graph Engine (GGE) 
Document Title: GGE Architecture & Design Document
Document Id: NS-GGP-003-ARCHITECTURE
Version: 0.2 
Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: Upon Material System Change
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines version 0.2 of the Governance Graph Engine (GGE) architecture, expanding the MVP design to explicitly include a Frontend (FE) MVP layer.
The objective is to ensure that auditability, transparency, and governance visibility are first-class system features from day one — not retrofits.
2. Design Philosophy (Reaffirmed)
GGE is built on the following non-negotiable principles:
 Governance-first architecture – the system enforces rules, not users
 Deterministic execution – LLMs advise, code decides
 Auditability by default – every action is traceable
 Graph-native reasoning – dependencies determine behavior
 Transparency over obscurity – governance state must be visible
 Incremental extensibility – FE starts read-only, expands later
3. High-Level System Overview
GGE now consists of six core layers:
 Data Layer (Source of Truth)
 Graph & Dependency Layer
 Decision Intelligence Layer (LLM-assisted)
 Workflow & Versioning Layer
 SOP Compilation & Output Layer
 Frontend Visibility & Audit Layer (NEW)
4. Core Backend Components (Unchanged, Contextualized)
4.1 Component Registry
Stores atomic governance components:
  Authority Matrix
  Materiality Thresholds
  Risk & Compliance Elements
These components drive all downstream SOP behavior.
4.2 Dependency Graph Engine
Maintains directed relationships between:
  Components
  SOPs
  Other components
The graph determines impact scope and update order.
4.3 Update Decision Engine (LLM-assisted)
Provides strategic reasoning:
  Impact classification
  Update sequencing
  Version bump recommendation
  Rationale generation
All outputs are validated and constrained by system rules.
4.4 Workflow & Versioning Engine
Orchestrates the lifecycle of a governance update:
 Component Change Detected
 Impact Analysis
 Update Plan Proposed
 Approval Gate
 SOP Regeneration
 Release & Logging
4.5 SOP Compiler
Generates versioned SOP artifacts:
  Markdown (authoritative)
  Exportable formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
Each SOP version is cryptographically and logically tied to its trigger events.
5. Frontend (FE) MVP Layer (NEW)
The FE MVP is intentionally read-only, focused on visibility and assurance, not control.
5.1 FE Objectives
  Provide transparency into GGE operations
  Support audit, review, and governance oversight
  Eliminate black-box perception of automation
  Enable rapid historical reconstruction
5.2 FE Screen 1: GGE Audit Trail Dashboard
Purpose: Full visibility into every execution of GGE.
Core Capabilities:
  Chronological list of GGE execution events
  Filter by:
  Date range
  Triggering component
  SOP affected
  Executing user / system actor
Displayed Data:
  Execution ID
  Trigger source (component + version)
  Affected SOPs
  Decision summary
  Approval outcomes
  Timestamp
Data Source:
  update_events
  approval_events
  sop_versions
5.3 FE Screen 2: SOP Version History & Registry
Purpose: Centralized visibility into all SOP artifacts.
Core Capabilities:
  List of all SOPs
  Expandable view of all historical versions
  Direct access to:
  Published SOP documents
  Version metadata
Displayed Data:
  SOP title & ID
  Current active version
  Historical versions
  Triggering component(s)
  Effective dates
Data Source:
  sops
  sop_versions
  component_versions
6. FE–BE Integration Model
6.1 API-First Design
The FE consumes read-only APIs exposed by the backend:
  GET /audit/events
  GET /sops
  GET /sops/{id}/versions
  GET /components/{id}/history
No mutation endpoints are exposed in MVP.
7. Data Model (FE-Relevant Additions)
No new core tables are required.
However, the following tables are explicitly FE-facing:
  update_events
  approval_events
  sop_versions
  component_versions
Indexes should be optimized for:
  Timestamp queries
  SOP-based filtering
  Component-based filtering

9. Frontend Stack (MVP Recommendation)
Recommended:
  React (TypeScript)
  Minimal UI framework (e.g., Tailwind or equivalent)
  Read-only authentication context
Design Constraints:
  No write actions in MVP
  No approval actions in MVP
  Focus on clarity, traceability, and navigation
10. Governance & Security Boundaries
  FE users cannot mutate data
  All actions are executed via BE
  Audit logs are immutable
  Access control enforced at API layer
11. MVP Success Criteria (Updated)
  Deterministic SOP regeneration
  Full audit trail visible via FE
  Complete SOP version history accessible
  Clear lineage from component → decision → SOP
  Zero manual SOP drift
12. Future FE Expansion (Explicitly Out of Scope)
  Approval actions
  Component editing
  Threshold modification
  User role management
  External advisor portals
These are intentionally deferred to preserve governance integrity.

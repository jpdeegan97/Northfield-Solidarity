Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the architecture of the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP).
It describes:
  core services and components
  how work is created, assigned, supervised, and escalated
  interaction patterns with other Northfield Solidarity engines
  architectural safeguards that make agentic work safe, auditable, and governable
2. Architectural Principles
 Work Is a First-Class Artifact — tasks, missions, and programs are persisted entities
 Separation of Orchestration from Execution — CWP coordinates; engines execute
 Human Authority Is Explicit — review and escalation are modeled, not implied
 Event-Sourced Supervision — all state transitions emit events
 Governance Alignment — GGP constraints are enforced, not bypassed
3. High-Level Architecture Overview
CWP is composed of six logical layers:
 Work Definition Layer
 Assignment & Scheduling Layer
 Execution Supervision Layer
 Review & Escalation Layer
 Event & Audit Layer
 Query & Visualization Layer
CWP is horizontally integrated across all engines.
4. Core Components
4.1 Work Registry
Responsibilities:
  persist tasks, missions, and programs
  manage work state transitions
  maintain relationships between work artifacts
This is the canonical source of truth for “what work exists.”
4.2 Agent Registry
Responsibilities:
  register agents (human, AI, hybrid)
  maintain capability and trust metadata
  resolve agent availability and assignment eligibility
Agent identity is resolved via IDN.
4.3 Assignment & Scheduler
Responsibilities:
  assign work to agents based on capability and availability
  enforce SLAs and cadence
  trigger work start conditions (time, event, manual)
Schedulers never execute work directly.
4.4 Supervision Engine
Responsibilities:
  monitor task progress
  detect stalls, failures, or SLA breaches
  advance work state based on reported outcomes
The supervision engine is reactive and event-driven.
4.5 Review & Escalation Engine
Responsibilities:
  enforce checkpoints
  route work outputs for human or role-based review
  trigger escalations on failure or risk
Escalations may route to:
  humans
  governance workflows (GGP)
  program owners
4.6 Event & Audit Ledger
Responsibilities:
  capture all work-related events
  maintain immutable history
  support replay and forensic analysis
This ledger underpins compliance and observability.
4.7 Query & Visualization Layer
Responsibilities:
  provide real-time visibility into work status
  support dashboards and operator UIs
  expose APIs for downstream analytics (e.g., PTE)
This layer is read-only.
5. Interaction With Other Engines
5.1 DRE (Deep Research Engine)
  CWP creates research missions linked to themes/hypotheses
  DRE performs research; CWP supervises progress
  outputs flow back as work completion events
5.2 PIE / SIM / DAT
  CWP coordinates insight generation, simulation runs, and execution planning
  domain engines retain ownership of outputs
5.3 GGP (Governance Graph Processor)
  CWP enforces governance constraints
  escalates exceptions or gated actions
  never authorizes decisions independently
5.4 IDN (Identity & Entity Nexus)
  resolves agent identities and roles
  provides authentication and attribution
5.5 PTE (Portfolio Tracking Engine)
  consumes work outcomes and metrics
  tracks performance of programs and missions
6. Deployment Topology (Logical)
  cwp-api (work registry, assignment)
  cwp-supervisor (state monitoring)
  cwp-review (checkpoints, escalation)
  cwp-scheduler (cadence, triggers)
  cwp-projector (read models)
Components may be scaled independently.
7. Failure & Degraded Modes
  agent unavailable → reassignment
  engine unavailable → work paused
  governance unavailable → escalation queued
CWP prioritizes visibility over silent failure.
8. Security & Access Control
  role-based access to work actions
  write actions require actor attribution
  escalation and closure require elevated roles
All actions are logged.

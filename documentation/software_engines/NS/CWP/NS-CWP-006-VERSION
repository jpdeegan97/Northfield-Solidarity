Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the versioning model for the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP).
Versioning in CWP ensures:
work evolution without loss of history
reproducible operational decisions
auditable agentic behavior
safe change management across programs, missions, and tasks
CWP versioning applies to work artifacts, decision logic, and operational configurations.
2. Versioning Principles
Append-Only History — prior versions are never mutated or deleted
Explicit Version Increments — semantic change always creates a new version
Separation of Work vs Rules — work artifacts and decision rules version independently
Replayability — historical work execution can be reconstructed
Governance Alignment — version transitions respect GGP constraints
3. Versioned Artifact Types
The following CWP artifacts are versioned:
Task Definitions
Mission Definitions
Program Definitions
Agent Capability Profiles
SLA Definitions
Decision Rulesets
Escalation Policies
Review Templates
Runtime execution state is not versioned; it is event-sourced.
4. Work Artifact Versioning
4.1 Task Versioning
Each task has:
task_id (stable)
task_version (monotonic)
A new task version is created when:
description changes
inputs/outputs change
constraints change
acceptance criteria change
4.2 Mission Versioning
Missions aggregate tasks.
New mission versions are created when:
task composition changes
success criteria change
SLA or priority changes
Existing task versions remain referenced.
4.3 Program Versioning
Programs represent long-running intent.
New program versions are created when:
strategic goals change
governance constraints change
cadence changes
Programs may run multiple mission versions concurrently.
5. Agent & Capability Versioning
5.1 Agent Capability Profiles
Capabilities evolve over time.
Version triggers:
new capability added
trust level changes
certification/validation updates
Historical assignments retain original capability references.
6. SLA & Policy Versioning
6.1 SLA Versioning
New SLA versions are created when:
response time changes
completion window changes
quality thresholds change
SLA versions apply prospectively, not retroactively.
6.2 Escalation Policy Versioning
Escalation rules are versioned independently.
Each escalation decision references:
escalation_policy_id
escalation_policy_version
7. Decision Ruleset Versioning
CWP decision logic (assignment, escalation, closure) is versioned.
Each decision artifact records:
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
This guarantees interpretability of historical decisions.
8. Compatibility & Replay
Change Type
Backward Compatible
Requires Replay
New task version
Yes
No
Mission composition change
No
No
SLA threshold change
Yes
No
Decision ruleset change
Yes
Yes
Escalation policy change
Yes
Yes
Replay uses:
work events
versioned definitions
versioned rulesets
9. Cross-Engine Version Alignment
Engine
Interaction
DRE
Missions reference research artifact versions
PIE
Tasks reference insight versions
SIM
Missions reference scenario versions
DAT
Tasks reference plan versions
GGP
Governs promotion and constraint changes
PTE
Tracks outcomes by work version
10. Failure Scenarios
missing version reference → execution blocked
incompatible ruleset → human review required
retroactive SLA application → forbidden

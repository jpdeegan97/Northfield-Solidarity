Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
Purpose
Defines the end-to-end lifecycle of work in CWP: definition → assignment → execution → supervision → review → escalation → closure → analysis.
Lifecycle Stages
 Work Definition — create Task/Mission/Program with constraints, success criteria, SLA
 Assignment & Scheduling — resolve eligible agents, bind schedule
 Execution — agents act only within assigned scope
 Supervision — monitor progress, SLA, anomalies
 Review & Acceptance — explicit checkpoint-based review
 Escalation — routed to human/program owner/GGP as needed
 Completion & Closure — close only after acceptance
 Post-Execution Analysis — metrics to PTE
Invariants
  No execution without assignment
  No completion without review
  No silent failure; escalation is mandatory

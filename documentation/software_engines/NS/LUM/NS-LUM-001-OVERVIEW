NS-LUM-001 — OVERVIEW

0. Overview

Luminance Engine (LUM) is the observability and reliability platform for Northfield Solidarity. It provides standardized collection, correlation, and presentation of telemetry and evidence signals across all engines and external integrations.

LUM’s goal is to make execution visible, explainable, and supportable—so incidents are detected early, resolved quickly, and audited reliably.

LUM is not a governance authority. GGP defines what must be logged, what approvals exist, and who may access sensitive evidence. LUM implements the telemetry/evidence plumbing and surfaces.

1. Why LUM Exists

As the number of engines and integrations grows, observability must be:

Consistent (shared schemas and correlation)

Centralized (single place to see system health and incidents)

Audit-grade (traceable actions and evidence bundles)

Actionable (alerts + runbooks + incident workflows)

Without LUM, each engine tends to:

log differently

alert inconsistently

lose context across distributed workflows

leave gaps in audit trails

2. Core Capabilities

2.1 Telemetry collection

LUM ingests:

Logs (structured, redacted)

Metrics (SLIs: error rate, latency, throughput, saturation)

Traces (distributed tracing: trace/span)

Events (workflow and integration events)

2.2 Correlation & context propagation

LUM standardizes and enforces correlation fields so that a single action can be followed end-to-end.

Minimum correlation set:

request_id

trace_id / span_id

workflow_id

decision_id (GGP)

integration_id (external API integration)

entity_id (IDN)

job_id / task_id (CWP/CDE/DAT)

2.3 Reliability management

SLIs/SLOs and error budgets

Alert routing and escalation policies

Noise reduction (dedupe, suppression, severity thresholds)

2.4 Incident lifecycle

Incident creation (manual or automatic)

Timeline and event stitching

Runbook linkage

Postmortem packet templates

Action-item export/handoff to CWP

2.5 Evidence support (audit-grade)

LUM supports evidence by:

persisting immutable-ish copies/metadata (where required)

linking evidence to decisions (GGP) and ledger entries (FLO)

maintaining chain-of-custody metadata

LUM does not decide what evidence is required; it fulfills GGP requirements.

3. LUM’s Relationship to Other Engines

3.1 GGP (Governance Graph Processor)

GGP defines the governance policies that require audit events/evidence.

LUM enforces observability standards and stores/serves required evidence signals.

3.2 IDN (Identity & Entity Nexus)

IDN provides actor/entity identity for correlation and access control.

LUM uses entity_id and role/claim metadata for secure evidence access.

3.3 FLO (Financial Ledger Orchestrator)

FLO actions must be traceable and auditable.

LUM links financial events to decision_id, workflow_id, and ledger references.

3.4 CWP (Cognitive Work Plane)

CWP emits task/work events.

LUM correlates tasks to system events, failures, and evidence bundles.

3.5 MUX / SIG / DRE / CDE / DAT

MUX: integration calls and webhooks (external API reliability)

SIG/DRE: ingestion workflows and research pipeline observability

CDE: distribution jobs and delivery receipts

DAT: execution pipelines where idempotency and retries must be observable

4. Operating Model

4.1 What “good” looks like

Every external API call is traceable to:

the initiating actor/entity

the governing decision (if any)

the workflow/task that caused it

the resulting side effect (receipt, ledger entry, published artifact)

Incidents are:

detected by SLIs/alerts

diagnosable via correlated traces and logs

resolved with a runbook

closed with a postmortem packet

4.2 Standard signal categories

Health: service up/down, dependency health

Performance: latency, throughput

Correctness: error rates, schema mismatches, idempotency collisions

Governance: blocked actions, missing evidence, approval timeouts

Security: auth failures, key rotation failures, suspicious access patterns

4.3 Storage tiers (conceptual)

Hot: recent logs/metrics/traces for rapid incident response

Warm: longer retention for trend analysis

Evidence: immutable-ish store for governed audit bundles (access controlled)

5. Key Interfaces

5.1 Ingest interfaces

Log shipping (structured JSON)

Metrics scrape/push

Trace export (OpenTelemetry-style)

Event stream subscription (Pub/Sub or internal bus)

5.2 Query and surfacing

Dashboards by engine, integration, workflow

Trace explorer

Incident console

Evidence viewer (policy-controlled)

5.3 Alerting

Severity taxonomy and routing

Paging and notification connectors

Automated incident creation triggers

6. MVP Definition (First Shipping Slice)

MVP LUM should deliver:

A single normalized event schema (logs + events)

Correlation ID enforcement in core services

External integration dashboards for:

Coinbase Commerce

Google Maps Platform

Alerting for:

webhook failure/replay anomalies

quota/rate-limit breaches

elevated error rate and latency

Incident record with timeline + runbook link + resolution notes

7. Success Metrics

Mean time to detect (MTTD) decreases

Mean time to resolve (MTTR) decreases

Percentage of governed actions with complete audit correlation approaches 100%

Reduction in “unknown root cause” incidents

Fewer false-positive alerts (alert hygiene)

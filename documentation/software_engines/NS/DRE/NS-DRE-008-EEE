Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides a concrete end-to-end example (EEE) illustrating how the Deep Research Engine (DRE) operates across its full lifecycle — from raw source ingestion to governed promotion into downstream engines.
The goal is to validate:
  evidence provenance
  hypothesis evolution
  confidence management
  governance-controlled promotion
  replay and auditability
2. Scenario Overview
Scenario:
Northfield Solidarity is exploring small-scale warehouse automation for regional 3PL operators.
The research question:
Is there a durable cost and throughput advantage in adopting mid-cap autonomous picking robots for regional warehouses?
DRE will:
  collect evidence
  form and evolve a hypothesis
  synthesize a narrative
  promote validated research to PIE and SIM
3. Step 1 — Source Discovery & Registration
Sources Identified:
  vendor whitepapers (robotics vendors)
  logistics trade publications
  warehouse automation case studies
Actions:
  sources registered in source
  credibility and bias notes recorded
Artifacts Created:
  source_id = SRC-101, SRC-102, SRC-103
4. Step 2 — Evidence Capture
Evidence Items Captured:
  EV-201: throughput benchmarks from vendor A
  EV-202: cost breakdown from 3PL case study
  EV-203: failure rate discussion from forum
Each evidence item is:
  timestamped
  fingerprinted
  immutable
5. Step 3 — Theme & Hypothesis Creation
Theme Created:
  Theme: “Regional Warehouse Automation”
Hypothesis v1:
“Mid-cap autonomous picking robots reduce per-unit fulfillment cost by ≥15% in regional warehouses.”
Initial state:
  hypothesis_version = 1
  state = open
  confidence = 0.45
Citations link EV-201 and EV-202.
6. Step 4 — Synthesis & Narrative Draft
Narrative Draft v1:
  summarizes throughput gains
  highlights cost reduction mechanisms
  notes operational risks
Narrative is:
  editable
  linked to hypothesis v1
7. Step 5 — Confidence Update
New Evidence:
  EV-204: maintenance downtime report
Decision:
  classify EV-204 as counter-evidence
  update confidence
Hypothesis v2:
  confidence = 0.62
  state = supported
Prior version remains intact.
8. Step 6 — Promotion Request
Promotion Request Created:
  artifact: hypothesis v2 + narrative v1
  target engines: PIE, SIM
  rationale: sustained cost advantage with bounded risk
Request is immutable once submitted.
9. Step 7 — Governance Review (GGP)
GGP Review Checks:
  evidence coverage sufficient
  confidence above threshold
  narrative accepted
Outcome: approved
Governance Ref: GGP-APR-7781
10. Step 8 — Downstream Consumption
PIE:
  incorporates hypothesis into opportunity scoring
SIM:
  uses cost-reduction assumption in scenarios
Downstream engines consume a promotion snapshot, not live research.
11. Step 9 — Iteration & Evolution
New Evidence Appears:
  EV-205: energy cost volatility
Actions:
  evidence captured
  hypothesis v3 created
  confidence adjusted
Previously promoted version remains valid for historical decisions.
12. Audit & Replay Validation
Questions Answered:
 Why was the hypothesis promoted?
  evidence citations + decision artifact
 What changed confidence?
  EV-204 counter-evidence
 Can we replay conclusions as of promotion?
  replay hypothesis v2 + ruleset_version
13. Invariants Demonstrated
  evidence is immutable
  hypotheses evolve via versions
  confidence updates are explicit
  promotion is governed
  downstream engines consume frozen snapshots

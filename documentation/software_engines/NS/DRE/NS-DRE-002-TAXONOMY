Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
The taxonomy specifies all atomic research components that serve as the source-of-truth for long-horizon knowledge, evidence, and hypothesis tracking. These components are designed to be:
composable
versioned
explainable
governable
This taxonomy prevents research sprawl and ensures consistent downstream interpretation.
2. Taxonomy Design Principles
Evidence First — claims cannot exist without evidence
Explicit Uncertainty — confidence is always quantified or described
Versioned Knowledge — research evolves without erasing history
Separation of Claim and Proof — hypotheses reference evidence; they do not embed it
Promotion Is Governed — moving research downstream requires approval
3. Core Research Primitives
3.1 Source
Represents an origin of information.
Attributes:
source_id
source_type (paper, filing, forum, vendor, interview)
publisher / author
credibility_score
bias_notes
first_seen_at
Sources are stable references.
3.2 Evidence Item
Atomic unit of captured proof.
Attributes:
evidence_id
source_id
excerpt / data payload
capture_method (manual, crawler, agent)
captured_at
relevance_tags
Evidence items are immutable.
3.3 Citation
Links evidence to research artifacts.
Attributes:
citation_id
evidence_id
cited_by (artifact_id)
citation_context
4. Research Artifacts
4.1 Theme
A long-horizon research area.
Attributes:

description
status (emerging, active, declining)
created_at
4.2 Subtheme
A focused dimension of a theme.
Attributes:
subtheme_id
theme_id
description
4.3 Hypothesis
A testable research claim.
Attributes:
hypothesis_id
statement

5.2 Evidence Bundle
A curated set of evidence supporting a claim.
Attributes:

completeness_score
6. Relationship & Graph Elements
6.1 Entity
Referenced real-world or conceptual entity.
Attributes:
entity_id (IDN canonical)
entity_type (company, technology, regulation)
6.2 Relationship
Assertion about entities.
Attributes:
relationship_id
subject_entity_id
predicate
object_entity_id
temporal_scope
confidence
Relationships reference evidence via citations.
7. Versioned State & Promotion Artifacts
7.1 Research Version
Represents a snapshot of a research artifact.
Attributes:
artifact_id
artifact_type
version
created_at
change_summary
7.2 Promotion Request
Request to promote research downstream.
Attributes:
promotion_id
artifact_id
target_engine (PIE, SIM, DAT)
rationale
status
Governed by GGP.
8. Cross-Engine Taxonomy Alignment
Engine
DRE Element Consumed
PIE
Themes, hypotheses, narratives
SIM
Assumptions, drivers, confidence
DAT
Vendor/supply research, constraints
GGP
Promotion requests, audit trail
SIG
Evidence references (optional)
9. Taxonomy Invariants
hypotheses must reference evidence via citations
confidence is mandatory for claims
evidence items are immutable
promotions require governance approval
10. Document Position in DRE Corpus
This taxonomy underpins all other DRE documents.
It informs:
NS-DRE-003 — ARCHITECTURE
NS-DRE-004 — LIFECYCLE
NS-DRE-007 — DATAMODEL

Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the versioning model for the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
Versioning in DRE ensures:
research evolution without loss of history
reproducible synthesis and confidence states
auditable promotion of research downstream
deterministic replay of past research conclusions
2. Versioning Principles
Append-Only Knowledge — prior versions are never mutated or deleted
Explicit Version Increments — any semantic change creates a new version
Separation of Content vs Logic — research artifacts and decision rules version independently
Replay Fidelity — historical conclusions can be reconstructed exactly
Governed Promotion Snapshots — downstream engines consume frozen versions
3. Versioned Artifact Types
The following DRE artifacts are versioned:
Evidence Items (logical versioning via capture time)
Hypotheses
Research Narratives
Evidence Bundles
Themes / Subthemes
Assumptions
Decision Rulesets
Promotion Snapshots
4. Evidence Versioning
4.1 Evidence Items
evidence items are immutable
new evidence creates a new item, never an update
4.2 Evidence Corrections
corrections are recorded as supplemental evidence
original evidence remains intact
5. Hypothesis Versioning
5.1 Hypothesis Identity
Each hypothesis has:
hypothesis_id (stable)
hypothesis_version (monotonic)
5.2 Version Triggers
A new hypothesis version is created when:
confidence score changes
supporting or contradicting evidence changes
hypothesis state changes
statement text changes
6. Narrative Versioning
narratives are versioned documents
drafts may change freely
accepted narratives are immutable
revisions create new versions
Narratives reference specific hypothesis versions.
7. Theme & Assumption Versioning
themes evolve slowly and are versioned on semantic change
assumptions are versioned when confidence or description changes
Downstream engines consume assumption versions explicitly.
8. Decision Ruleset Versioning
decision logic (confidence thresholds, relevance heuristics) is versioned
every decision artifact references its ruleset_version
This guarantees interpretability of historical decisions.
9. Promotion Snapshot Versioning
When research is promoted:
a promotion snapshot is created
snapshot includes:
artifact_id
artifact_version
decision_ruleset_version
promotion_timestamp
Downstream engines consume snapshots, not live artifacts.
10. Compatibility & Replay
Change Type
Backward Compatible
Requires Replay
New evidence
Yes
Optional
Confidence logic change
Yes
Yes
Hypothesis revision
No (new version)
No
Narrative update
No (new version)
No
11. Cross-Engine Version Alignment
Engine
Version Interaction
PIE
Consumes promoted hypothesis/narrative versions
SIM
Consumes assumption versions
DAT
Consumes sourcing research snapshots
GGP
Governs promotion approvals
12. Failure Scenarios
missing version reference → promotion blocked
ruleset mismatch → human review required
incompatible downstream schema → promotion rejected

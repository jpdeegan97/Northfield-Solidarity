Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose
The Deep Research Engine (DRE) is responsible for continuously tracking, synthesizing, and curating deep research across markets, technologies, competitors, and execution pathways — and mapping those findings into structured, queryable, versioned artifacts.
DRE exists to answer a single core question:
What matters over the medium-to-long horizon, what evidence supports it, and how confident are we?
DRE is not a news feed. It is a research memory and synthesis engine.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
DRE sits in the long-horizon intelligence layer and complements PIE and SIG:
  SIG aggregates and normalizes short-horizon signals
  PIE turns signals into decision-ready product insights
  DRE maintains deep context, thematic tracking, and evidence trails over time
DRE feeds:
  PIE (context, hypotheses, research artifacts)
  SIM (assumptions and scenario drivers)
  DAT (sourcing/logistics/partner research for execution)
  GGP (auditability, provenance, and governance of research promotion)
3. What DRE Produces
DRE produces Research Artifacts, which are structured, versioned objects such as:
  Themes (e.g., “home battery arbitrage”, “warehouse robotics”)
  Hypotheses (testable claims linked to evidence)
  Evidence Bundles (citations, notes, excerpts, datasets)
  Research Narratives (human-readable syntheses)
  Source & Credibility Profiles (trust, recency, bias notes)
  Knowledge Graph Edges (entities, relationships, time-bound assertions)
All outputs are:
  explainable
  attributable
  replayable (rebuildable from evidence + ruleset)
4. What DRE Does Not Do
To maintain clean boundaries, DRE does not:
  authorize decisions or releases (GGP)
  execute market actions (DAT)
  run financial accounting (FLO)
  act as the identity authority (IDN)
DRE produces research truth; others decide and act.
5. Core Capabilities
 Continuous Collection & TrackingMonitor sources (papers, docs, forums, filings, vendor sites) and track changes over time.
 Evidence Capture & ProvenanceStore citations and evidence chains that explain every claim.
 Synthesis & Narrative ConstructionConvert raw evidence into coherent, structured research narratives.
 Hypothesis ManagementDefine testable hypotheses, track supporting/counter evidence, and update confidence.
 Thematic Maps & TrendlinesMaintain long-horizon themes, subthemes, and causal drivers.
 Promotion PathwaysPromote validated research into PIE insights, SIM assumptions, or DAT execution research — governed by GGP.
6. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to DRE
SIG
Provides short-horizon signals that may seed research threads
PIE
Consumes research artifacts to improve insight quality and explanation
SIM
Consumes assumptions, drivers, and hypothesis states
DAT
Consumes sourcing/logistics/vendor research and constraint knowledge
GGP
Governs promotion, controls, audit, and versioning of research artifacts
IDN
Provides canonical actor/entity attribution for artifacts and sources
CDE
Distributes research reports/briefings (if released)
CWP
Supervises agentic researchers and schedules research programs
7. Operational Posture
DRE is:
  write-heavy (evidence ingestion + artifact updates)
  read-heavy (query and retrieval for PIE/SIM/DAT)
  versioned and replayable (audit-grade provenance)
  human-in-the-loop friendly (research curation and review)
8. Expected Outcomes
When DRE is functioning correctly:
  research compounds over time instead of being lost
  hypotheses become clearer and more testable
  decisions are better grounded in evidence
  downstream engines operate with stronger context and fewer surprises
DRE reduces epistemic drift.

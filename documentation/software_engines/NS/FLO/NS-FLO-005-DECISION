Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework used by the Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO).
FLO decisions do not approve strategy or execution. Instead, they:
Determine financial classification correctness
Enforce budget and allocation constraints
Resolve reconciliation outcomes
Gate manual overrides and adjustments
All FLO decisions are deterministic, auditable, and versioned.
2. Decision Design Principles
Ledger Supremacy — once written, ledger entries are never changed
Separation of Authority — FLO enforces, GGP approves
Explainability — every decision produces structured rationale
Fail Closed on Risk — ambiguity blocks mutation, not truth
Human-in-the-Loop for Exceptions — overrides are governed
3. Decision Categories
FLO makes decisions in five primary categories:
Ingestion & Deduplication Decisions
Classification Decisions
Ledger Write Admission Decisions
Budget & Allocation Enforcement Decisions
Reconciliation Outcome Decisions
Each category emits a Decision Artifact.
4. Ingestion & Deduplication Decisions
4.1 Deduplication Decision
Question: Is this financial event already represented?
Inputs:
source_system
external_event_id
correlation_id
Outcomes:
dedupe.accept
dedupe.reject_duplicate
Notes:
Rejected duplicates are logged, not discarded
5. Classification Decisions
5.1 Transaction Classification Decision
Question: How should this normalized event be represented financially?
Inputs:
normalized_financial_event
classification_ruleset_version
Outputs:
transaction_type
debit_account
credit_account
entity attribution
budget/allocation reference (if applicable)
Failure Mode:
classification.blocked (ambiguous mapping)
6. Ledger Write Admission Decisions
6.1 Ledger Admission Decision
Question: Can this transaction candidate be written to the ledger?
Inputs:
transaction_candidate
dedupe status
classification completeness
Outcomes:
ledger.write_allowed
ledger.write_blocked
Block Reasons:
Missing account attribution
Invalid entity reference
Broken transaction balance
Blocked candidates are queued for review.
7. Budget & Allocation Enforcement Decisions
7.1 Budget Evaluation Decision
Question: Does this ledger entry violate an approved budget?
Inputs:
ledger_entry
budget_snapshot
Outcomes:
budget.ok
budget.near_limit
budget.exhausted
Actions:
Emit budget state change event
Surface violation to DAT and GGP
7.2 Allocation Enforcement Decision
Question: Does this spend exceed an allocation cap?
Outcomes:
allocation.ok
allocation.exceeded
Allocation violations are treated as hard stops unless otherwise approved.
8. Reconciliation Outcome Decisions
8.1 Ledger ↔ Statement Match Decision
Question: Does this external statement item match internal ledger truth?
Outcomes:
recon.matched
recon.missing
recon.excess
recon.disputed
Notes:
No reconciliation decision mutates ledger entries
9. Manual Override & Adjustment Decisions
9.1 Manual Adjustment Admission
Question: Is a manual adjustment allowed?
Requirements:
Governance approval (GGP reference)
Explicit reason
Operator identity
Outcomes:
manual.adjustment_allowed
manual.adjustment_blocked
Manual adjustments create new ledger entries.
10. Decision Artifacts
Every FLO decision produces a persisted artifact:
Decision Artifact Fields:
decision_id
decision_type
inputs (hash or reference)
outcome
rationale (structured)
ruleset_version
actor_type (system / operator / governance)
evaluated_at
correlation_id
Decision artifacts are immutable and replayable.
11. Determinism & Replay
Given the same inputs and ruleset version, decisions must be deterministic
Replays may produce different outcomes only when ruleset versions change
All rule changes are versioned and auditable
12. Cross-Engine Decision Boundaries



Engine

Responsibility


FLO

Financial correctness & enforcement


GGP

Policy approval & governance


DAT

Execution decisions


MUX

External truth sourcing
FLO never approves policy; it enforces approved policy.

NSDC Engine Charter — FLO (Financial Ledger Orchestration)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Financial Ledger Orchestration
Acronym: FLO
Engine Type: Ledger / Accounting / Execution Support
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to record, consolidate, and reconcile all financial transactions within the NSDC ecosystem, providing a canonical source of truth for capital flow, performance tracking, and audit compliance.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Maintain a unified, canonical ledger of all financial transactions
  Reconcile capital movements between engines and marketplaces
  Provide accurate reporting for P&L, balance sheets, and cash flows
  Integrate with execution engines (DAT) for transaction validation
  Feed financial summaries and insights to PIE, CDE, and administrative systems
  Ensure audit readiness and maintain immutable transaction logs
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Make capital allocation or trading decisions (DAT)
  Generate product or market intelligence (PIE)
  Publish content or manage engagement (CDE)
  Define governance rules (GGP)
  Directly manage external marketplace integrations (MUX)
FLO is strictly the ledger and reporting engine.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
FLO May Decide Autonomously:
  Validate transaction integrity
  Reconcile ledger balances
  Generate reports from ledger data
FLO Must Not Decide:
  Capital allocation or execution strategy
  Governance policy enforcement
  Product or market opportunity selection
FLO is a canonical financial observer and recorder, not an executor.
8. Governance & Constraints
  All ledger entries must comply with GGP-defined policies
  Must maintain immutable, auditable records
  Ensure reconciliations and validation procedures are enforced
  Integration with external APIs must comply with security and compliance standards
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Delayed reconciliation
  Minor ledger inconsistencies due to timing
Worst-Case Failure:
  Inaccurate financial reporting
  Compromised audit readiness
Blast Radius:
  Impacts all engines relying on canonical financial data
  No direct market execution impact if DAT operates independently, but may misreport P&L
Containment strategy:
  Reconciliation alerts
  Manual overrides with logging
  Immutable historical snapshots
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Accuracy, completeness, and auditability
  Time Horizon: Continuous recording with periodic reconciliations
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Canonical entity IDs (IDN)
  Product and transaction IDs (PIE / DAT)
  Governance flags and approvals (GGP)
  Order and execution objects (DAT)
  Ledger and audit schemas
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Transaction logging and ledger maintenance
  Integration with DAT for executed trades
  P&L and cashflow reporting
  Audit log creation
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive finance modeling
  Integration with external accounting systems beyond MVP
  Automated capital allocation or trading
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Canonical ledger + basic reporting
  Phase 2: Real-time reconciliation and dashboards
  Phase 3: Predictive analytics and integrated financial modeling

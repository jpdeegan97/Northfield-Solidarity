Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO)
1. Purpose
The Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO) is responsible for producing canonical, auditable, and reconcilable financial truth across the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
FLO exists to answer:
What money moved, why did it move, who/what authorized it, and where is the evidence?
FLO is the system layer that turns distributed engine activity into:
a coherent ledger
a traceable accounting narrative
an enforcement surface for budgets and financial controls
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
FLO sits in the financial truth and controls layer.
Upstream producers (examples):
DAT — spend, refunds, fees, payouts, COGS commitments
MUX — payment processor events, marketplace payouts, bank transfers
SIM — projected financial scenarios (non-authoritative)
PECA / IDN — entity + account identity references
Downstream consumers:
GGP — governance approval for budgets, allocations, and thresholds
PTE — portfolio performance attribution
Humans — finance ops, tax prep, reconciliation workflows
FLO does not execute market actions; it records, validates, reconciles, and reports the financial outcomes of actions.
3. What FLO Produces
FLO produces Ledger Artifacts, including:
Ledger Entries (debits/credits or canonical cash-flow records)
Account Balances (derived from ledger)
Reconciliation Reports (internal vs external)
Budget / Allocation States (authoritative spend tracking)
Evidence Links (receipts, invoices, processor IDs)
All FLO outputs are:
versioned
append-only
explainable
replayable
4. What FLO Does Not Do
To preserve system clarity and controls, FLO does not:
Approve governance policy (GGP)
Decide whether opportunities are good (PIE)
Execute actions in external systems (DAT/MUX)
Manage identities or permissions (IDN)
FLO records financial truth and enforces financial constraints as configured and approved.
5. Core Capabilities
Event-to-Ledger Ingestion
Consume financial-impacting events from engines and external systems.
Normalization & Classification
Map raw events to canonical transaction types, accounts, categories, and entities.
Budget Tracking & Enforcement
Maintain authoritative budget state and detect overruns.
Reconciliation
Reconcile ledger entries against external statements (processor, bank, marketplace).
Evidence & Audit Trail
Persist immutable evidence references and traceability links.
Reporting Surfaces
Provide read models for portfolio tracking, tax prep, and governance review.
6. Interaction With Other Engines



Engine

Relationship to FLO


DAT

Emits spend/fee/refund events; references budgets


MUX

Provides payment and payout events; external truth sources


GGP

Governs budget creation, thresholds, approvals


PTE

Consumes ledger-derived performance metrics


PECA / IDN

Provides entity/account identity references


SIM

Provides projections (non-authoritative)
FLO is the canonical financial truth layer; other engines should reference FLO outputs rather than maintain independent ledgers.
7. Operational Posture
FLO is:
Write-controlled (append-only ledger)
Audit-grade (strong traceability requirements)
Replayable (event and statement reprocessing)
Reconciliation-driven (external truth comparison)
FLO favors correctness and explainability over speed.
8. Expected Outcomes
When FLO is operating correctly:
Every spend and payout is attributable to a governed plan/version
Budgets are continuously tracked and overruns are surfaced early
Financial reconciliation is routine and automatable
Performance reporting is consistent and trusted
FLO makes finances governable.

1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Product InsightIQ Engine
Acronym: PIE
Engine Type: Intelligence / Knowledge
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to consolidate, analyze, and provide structured product and market intelligence to support informed decision-making across NSDC, enabling actionable insights for product development, sourcing, and market deployment.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Aggregate product and market data from internal and external sources
  Normalize and structure product identity, attributes, and variants
  Analyze trends, demand signals, and historical performance
  Provide insights for product research, sourcing, and strategic decisions
  Feed actionable intelligence to downstream engines (DAT, CDE)
  Maintain canonical product truth and historical performance records
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Execute trades or arbitrage opportunities
  Govern capital or risk thresholds
  Publish content or manage attention campaigns
  Maintain financial ledgers or accounting records
  Directly enforce operational actions without downstream engine mediation
PIE is the intelligence provider, not the executor or controller.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
PIE May Decide Autonomously:
  How to normalize, structure, and store product data
  How to prioritize trends and insights for relevance
PIE Must Not Decide:
  When or where to execute trades
  How capital is deployed
  How content is distributed
PIE informs decisions but does not act on them directly.
8. Governance & Constraints
  Must comply with GGP-defined policies on data usage and reporting
  Ensure historical and canonical data integrity
  Maintain versioning of insights and intelligence outputs
  Audit-ready data pipelines and transformation processes
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Data feed interruptions
  Normalization errors
  Trend misinterpretation
Worst-Case Failure:
  Downstream engines receive incorrect intelligence leading to suboptimal execution
Blast Radius:
  Decision impact on DAT or CDE outcomes
  No direct financial or compliance violation
Containment strategy:
  Data validation layers
  Automated integrity checks
  Logging and alerts
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Accuracy, completeness, and actionable intelligence
  Time Horizon: Continuous / strategic insight over daily and long-term horizons
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Product IDs and canonical references (IDN)
  Market identifiers
  Trend and signal schemas
  Historical performance records
  Governance flags and constraints (GGP)
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Aggregation and normalization of product data
  Historical performance tracking
  Market trend identification
  Feeding structured insights to DAT and CDE
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive ML for arbitrage
  Full automation of sourcing or content strategies
  External API integrations beyond MVP sources
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Structured aggregation and canonical product records
  Phase 2: Advanced trend analysis and predictive intelligence
  Phase 3: Fully integrated intelligence layer for real-time decisioning across NSDC

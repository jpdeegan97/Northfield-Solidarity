NS-PIE — Documentation Master Plan (Aligned to NS-GGP Canonical Template)

Purpose

This document defines the authoritative documentation master plan for PIE (Product InsightIQ Engine), strictly aligned to the NS-GGP canonical document structure (000–014).

PIE is Northfield Solidarity’s product research and product intelligence engine. It is responsible for:

market and product discovery

product catalog intelligence (attributes, pricing, demand proxies)

competitor and listing analysis

sourcing/logistics signal capture (vendor/3PL/lead-times)

roadmap outputs for building or selling products

packaging insight into actionable work (CWP tasks) and simulations (SIM)

PIE is not:

a governance authority (GGP)

the integration gateway itself (MUX)

the financial ledger (FLO)

the operational work coordinator (CWP)

PIE produces insights, structured datasets, and recommended actions, all governed by GGP.

FeatureVector (derived)

ScoreCard (outputs + confidence)

Dossier (narrative + citations)

Recommendation (action proposal) + EvidenceRefs

Outputs

Entity definitions + required fields

Correlation requirements (workflow_id, decision_id, integration_id)

NS-PIE-008 — EEE (End-to-End Example)

Purpose: Provide a full scenario showing PIE producing actionable outcomes.

Scope (example scenario)

Discover product candidates via SIG/DRE

Enrich with pricing, reviews, and supplier shortlist via MUX

Compute margin + demand proxy score

Route to CWP for human review + vendor outreach tasks

If approved, hand off to FLO (sample purchase) and SIM (scenario modeling)

LUM correlates the end-to-end workflow

Outputs

Sequence diagram

Happy path + failure path (data source unavailable, low confidence, policy blocked)

NS-PIE-009 — IMPL

Purpose: Implementation guidance and reference patterns.

Scope

Source ingestion patterns (pull vs push)

Normalization and deduping

Feature extraction (pricing history, review sentiment, volatility)

Scoring pipeline patterns (batch + streaming)

Citation/attribution and evidence handling

Confidence and quality scoring

Outputs

Reference pipeline skeleton

MVP build plan

NS-PIE-010 — FE (Optional Operator UI)

Purpose: Optional UI for operators and analysts.

Scope

Candidate browser (filter/sort)

Dossier viewer/editor

Score explanations (why this product ranks)

Source attribution viewer

“Create tasks in CWP” actions

Export packs (redacted)

Outputs

Page map

Role model and access constraints

NS-PIE-011 — APIMAP

Purpose: Define PIE’s API surfaces.

Scope

Purpose: Field-level definitions, enums, validation, and redaction rules.

Scope

Score definitions and confidence fields

Citation/source attribution fields

Redaction rules (never store secrets; handle personal data carefully)

High-cardinality constraints for labels/metrics

Outputs

Canonical field dictionary

Validation constraints + “never store” list

Notes on Alignment

PIE uses MUX for external provider calls and must not embed provider secrets.

PIE routes operational actions into CWP (tasks) rather than acting directly.

Any spending decisions or payments flow through FLO, governed by GGP.

PIE’s analysis is observable via LUM and should always emit correlation IDs.

PIE may consume signals from SIG and deep research outputs from DRE, but PIE is responsible for product-level normalization, scoring, and recommendations.

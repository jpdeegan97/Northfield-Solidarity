Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the frontend (FE) / visualization layer for PIE.
The FE layer exists to provide:
Human-readable insight exploration
Transparent evidence and reasoning inspection
Workflow-aligned review and handoff visibility
This document does not prescribe a specific UI framework; it defines canonical screens, components, interactions, and data needs.
2. FE Design Principles
Explainability FirstEvery insight must show “why” (evidence + reasoning), not just “what.”
Progressive DisclosureSummaries first, drill-down on demand.
Governance AwarenessApproval status and governance outcomes must be visible.
Replay & History VisibilityVersion history is a first-class view.
Operational SafetyFE surfaces do not execute actions; they only reveal and route.
3. Primary User Personas
Operator / Strategist — reviews ranked insights and selects candidates for governance review
Analyst — inspects evidence quality, model outputs, and counter-signals
Governance Reviewer — reviews the package that would be approved in GGP
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Insight Feed (Ranked List)
Goal: Rapid triage of the current insight universe.
Core Elements:
Ranking list with:Opportunity StatementConfidence ScoreRisk BandRelevance Window / decay indicatorStatus badge (Proposed / Under Review / Approved / Rejected / Expired)
Key Interactions:
Filter by status, type, time window
Sort by confidence, risk, freshness
Click to open Insight Detail
4.2 Insight Detail (Explainability View)
Goal: Full transparency into what PIE is claiming and why.
Sections:
Summary headerOpportunity StatementType, status, versionConfidence and risk summary
Evidence BundleSignals (SIG IDs, trust scores, timestamps)Research artifacts (DRE IDs, confidence)Evidence grouping and corroboration
Scoring & BreakdownScoring model versionFeature contributions (breakdown)
Risks & Counter-signalsRisk flagsExplicit counter evidence
Decay & RelevanceRelevance windowDecay rationale
Governance PanelPromotion readinessGGP decision linkage (if applicable)
4.3 Version History (Per Insight)
Goal: Allow auditors and operators to see how an Insight evolved.
Core Elements:
List of versions with:Version numberTimestampReason for change (evidence/model/governance)Key deltas (statement/risk/confidence)
Key Interactions:
Compare versions side-by-side
Pin a version for downstream reference
4.4 Evidence Source Explorer (Optional MVP)
Goal: Inspect signal sources for quality and noise.
Core Elements:
Source health panel (SIG)
Trust score distributions
Noise / decay tracking
This view may be deferred if SIG provides its own visibility.
5. Cross-Engine Visibility Requirements
PIE FE must surface upstream and downstream links:
SIG: show signal IDs and trust scores
DRE: show artifact IDs and confidence annotations
GGP: show governance decision ID and outcome
SIM: show scenario analysis linkage (if available)
PTE: show performance trajectories tied to an approved insight version
PIE FE may link out to these systems, but does not replace them.

7. Data Requirements (API Needs)
7.1 Insight Feed
Required fields:
insight_id
current_version
opportunity_statement
confidence_score
risk_band
status
relevance_window_end
updated_at
7.2 Insight Detail
Required fields:

8. Non-Functional Requirements
Fast read performance (ranked list must be instant)
Traceability (every displayed claim links to evidence)
Audit friendliness (stable IDs, version pins)
No execution affordances (no “run” buttons)
9. Document Position in PIE Corpus
This FE document is informed by:
NS-PIE-001 — OVERVIEW
NS-PIE-002 — TAXONOMY
NS-PIE-007 — DATAMODEL
It complements:
NS-PIE-011 — APIMAP
NS-PIE-012 — STATE

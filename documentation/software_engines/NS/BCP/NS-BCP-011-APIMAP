NS-BCP-011 — APIMAP

0. Document Control

1. Purpose

This document defines the API map for BCP, including:

internal service boundaries

external integrations (GGP/GGE, IDN, FLO, SIG, DRE, MUX)

minimum endpoints/events required for v1

BCP APIs are designed around:

registry-first (source of truth)

immutable provenance (release/deploy records)

policy enforcement (gates)

signals-as-data (events normalized into internal feeds)

SIG/FLO/IDN integrations

2.2 BCP Release Orchestrator (BCP-REL)

Purpose: executes releases (deploy/upgrade/migrate), writes results.

Primary consumers:

CI/CD pipelines

BCP FE (view; optionally trigger)

2.3 BCP Policy Gates (BCP-POL)

Purpose: evaluates release gates and produces policy check results.

Primary consumers:

output: execution_id

GET /executions/{execution_id}

status: queued/running/succeeded/failed

links to logs

5.2 Deployment Actions

POST /deploy

POST /upgrade

POST /migrate

Note: These endpoints may be internal-only. In many setups, orchestrator is pipeline-driven and exposes read-only status to FE.

POST /evaluate

inputs:

release_id or release_manifest

risk_class

links to artifacts (threat model, runbook, audit)

outputs:

gate results PASS/FAIL/WAIVE

evidence

6.2 Policies

GET /policies

GET /policies/{policy_name}

6.3 Waivers

POST /waivers

GET /waivers?system_id=&status=

7. Signals Exporter (BCP-SIGX) — v1

7.1 Ingestion

BCP-SIGX consumes:

chain logs/receipts via indexer or direct RPC

event schema registry (BCP-REG)

7.2 Output Feeds

Push to SIG/FLO via internal event bus (preferred)

Pull via API endpoints

Base: /bcp/signals/v1

GET /signals?system_id=&network_id=&since=

GET /alerts?system_id=&severity= (optional)

7.3 Canonical Signal Event Shape

{
  "signal_event_id": "...",
  "signal_def_id": "...",
  "system_id": "BCP-SYS-...",
  "network_id": "ARBMAIN",
  "block_number": 123456,
  "tx_hash": "0x...",
  "occurred_at": "2025-12-23T05:00:00Z",
  "severity": "INFO|WARN|ALERT",
  "type": "PRIVILEGED_ACTION|REVERT_SPIKE|PAUSE_STATE|INDEXER_LAG|VALUE_MOVEMENT",
  "payload": {"...": "..."},
  "attribution_identity_id": "IDN:..."
}

8. Governance Approval API (Integration Contract)

BCP treats governance as an external authority.

8.1 Approval Request (BCP → GGP/GGE)

{
  "request_type": "PROD_DEPLOY|UPGRADE|WAIVER",
  "release_id": "BCP-REL-20251223-001",
  "system_id": "BCP-SYS-TreasuryVault",
  "risk_class": "HIGH",
  "artifacts": {
    "threat_model_ref": "uri",
    "audit_report_ref": "uri",
    "runbook_ref": "uri"
  },
  "summary": "Deploy TreasuryVault v1.0.0 to ARBMAIN",
  "requested_by": "IDN:...",
  "requested_at": "..."
}

8.2 Approval Decision (GGP/GGE → BCP)

{
  "release_id": "BCP-REL-20251223-001",
  "decision": "APPROVED|DENIED|CONDITIONAL",
  "approvers": ["IDN:..."],
  "decision_ref": "uri",
  "notes": "...",
  "decided_at": "..."
}

9. API Security

9.1 AuthN/AuthZ

Auth via NS identity (IDN)

RBAC enforced at API and FE

separation of duties for PROD actions

9.2 Audit Logging

All write endpoints must produce:

actor identity

time

payload digest

result

correlation IDs (release_id, deployment_id)

10. Event Bus Topics (Optional but Recommended)

If NS has an internal event bus, BCP publishes/consumes:

Publish:

bcp.release.executed

bcp.deployment.recorded

bcp.policy.evaluated

bcp.signal.emitted

bcp.incident.created

Consume:

ggp.approval.decided

sig.alert.triggered

dre.advisory.published

NS-BCP-002 — TAXONOMY

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: BCP — Blockchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-BCP-002-TAXONOMY

Status: Draft v1

Depends On: NS-BCP-000-CHARTER, NS-BCP-001-OVERVIEW

Owner: BCP Lead (TBD)

1. Taxonomy Goals

This taxonomy defines the canonical vocabulary for BCP so that:

artifacts are named consistently

environments and deployments are unambiguous

ownership, custody, and authority are explicit

security controls can be automated and enforced

2. Core Domains

BCP is organized into five domains:

Contracts Domain — on-chain code and its lifecycle

dApp Domain — user-facing applications interacting with contracts

ChainOps Domain — deployments, environments, infrastructure, monitoring

Security & Assurance Domain — gates, reviews, audits, incidents

Data & Intelligence Domain — indexing, event streams, analytics, internal feeds

3. Entities (Nouns)

3.1 Blockchain Primitives

Chain / Network: a blockchain execution environment (e.g., mainnet/testnet) with a chain ID.

L1 / L2 / L3: settlement vs execution layers (BCP treats these as network attributes).

Account: an address capable of holding assets and sending transactions.

EOA (Externally Owned Account): a key-controlled account.

Contract Account: an account controlled by deployed bytecode.

Transaction (Tx): a state transition request.

Receipt: proof of execution including status and emitted logs/events.

Event / Log: emitted data for indexing and monitoring.

Block: ordered set of transactions.

Finality: confirmation confidence level (chain attribute).

3.2 Contract Lifecycle Entities

Contract Spec: human-readable functional + security requirements.

Contract Module / Package: deployable unit of contract code.

Contract Version: semantic version of a contract package.

Build Artifact: compiled bytecode, ABI, metadata, and source map.

Deployment: an instance of a contract version on a specific network.

Deployment Record: immutable record linking deployment to provenance (commit, build, signer, timestamp, config).

Constructor / Initializer Config: parameters required at deployment or first initialization.

Proxy / Implementation: upgradeable pattern components.

Upgrade: governed change to a deployed system (implementation switch, migration, parameter change).

Migration: state and/or data move from old system to new system.

Decommission: formal retirement of a deployment.

3.3 Authority & Control Entities

Owner: entity with ultimate administrative authority.

Admin: entity with operational authority (may be limited).

Role: named permissions grouping (e.g., MINTER, PAUSER).

Permission: atomic capability (e.g., call function X).

Guardian: emergency authority holder (pause/containment).

Timelock: delayed execution controller.

Multisig: M-of-N approval controller.

MPC Custody: distributed key custody mechanism.

Signer: identity used to authorize deployments/transactions.

Approver: identity required to authorize high-risk actions.

Policy: machine-enforceable rule set for actions and gates.

3.4 dApp & UX Entities

dApp: user-facing app interfacing with contracts.

Wallet Provider: component for key custody/signing (browser wallet, mobile wallet, embedded wallet).

Session: bounded authorization context for repeated actions.

Transaction Intent: pre-signing representation of user action.

Signature Request: request presented to user/wallet for approval.

Gas Strategy: fee estimation and fee-payer strategy.

Relayer: service that submits transactions (especially for sponsored gas).

Account Abstraction (AA): account model enabling policy-driven signing and fee abstraction.

3.5 ChainOps & Infrastructure Entities

Environment: BCP-managed stage (DEV/TEST/PROD).

RPC Provider: node access endpoint provider.

Indexer: service that ingests chain data and exposes query APIs.

Subgraph / Query Layer: structured indexing + query interface.

Node: blockchain client instance (self-hosted or managed).

Secrets Store: system of record for secrets and keys.

CI Pipeline: automated build/test/analysis flow.

CD Pipeline: automated deployment flow.

Release: versioned deployment event, tied to approvals.

Rollback / Containment: emergency action to reduce blast radius.

3.6 Security & Assurance Entities

Threat Model: structured risk analysis and mitigations.

Risk Class: categorical risk level (Low/Med/High/Critical).

Control: required safeguard (gate, review, policy).

Security Gate: mandatory check before production deploy.

Static Analysis: automated code analysis results.

Fuzzing / Property Tests: probabilistic and invariant testing.

Audit: external or internal security review.

Finding: issue identified by analysis/audit.

Remediation: fix + verification of finding closure.

Incident: security/availability event requiring response.

Postmortem: structured incident report and improvements.

3.7 Data & Intelligence Entities

Event Schema: canonical definition of emitted events.

Normalized Signal: standardized internal representation of on-chain events.

Metric: quantified signal (latency, error rate, volume).

Alert: threshold-based or anomaly-based trigger.

Dashboard: operational visualization.

Data Feed: output stream to other NS engines.

Attribution Record: mapping of on-chain actions to identities (via IDN policy).

4. Artifact Types

4.1 Code Artifacts

Contract source code

Contract libraries (shared primitives)

dApp codebase

Infrastructure-as-code (IaC)

Indexer definitions/subgraphs

4.2 Build Artifacts

ABI

Bytecode

Deployment manifests

Source maps

SBOM-like dependency snapshot (recommended)

4.3 Governance & Security Artifacts

Threat model

Upgrade policy

Ownership/role matrix

Release approval record

Audit reports and remediation tracker

Runbooks

Incident postmortems

5. Environment Taxonomy

BCP environments are explicit and non-overlapping:

BCP-ENV-DEV: local dev, forks, rapid iteration

BCP-ENV-TEST: shared integration testing and staging rehearsals

BCP-ENV-PROD: mainnet / production-grade networks

Each environment has:

allowed networks

allowed custody/signer types

gating requirements

observability requirements

6. Network Taxonomy

Networks are categorized by:

Type: L1 / L2 / L3

Purpose: devnet / testnet / mainnet

Finality Profile: probabilistic vs near-instant vs delayed

Reliability Profile: RPC redundancy requirements

Compliance Profile: any constraints required by NS policy

7. Naming Conventions

7.1 General Pattern

{NS}-{BCP}-{DOMAIN}-{NAME}-{QUALIFIERS}

7.2 Contract Packages

BCP-CONTRACT-{PackageName}

Versions use SemVer: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

7.3 Deployments

BCP-DEPLOY-{PackageName}-{Network}-{Stage}

Example: BCP-DEPLOY-TreasuryVault-ARBMAIN-PROD

7.4 Roles & Policies

BCP-ROLE-{RoleName}

BCP-POLICY-{PolicyName}

7.5 Runbooks & Dashboards

BCP-RUNBOOK-{SystemName}-{Scenario}

BCP-DASH-{SystemName}

8. Classification Systems

8.1 Risk Class (v1)

Low: limited scope, low value, no privileged actions

Medium: moderate privileges or moderate value at risk

High: meaningful privileges or significant value at risk

Critical: systemic privileges, large value at risk, or public-facing core protocol

Risk class influences:

audit requirements

custody requirements

approval chain

monitoring intensity

8.2 Change Class (v1)

Patch: minor fixes, no storage layout/behavioral change that affects safety

Minor: new features, backward compatible

Major: breaking changes, migrations likely

Emergency: time-sensitive containment or fix

9. Relationship Map (High-Level)

Contract Package → produces Build Artifact

Build Artifact + Config + Signer → creates Deployment

Deployment → emits Events → ingested by Indexer → produces Signals/Metrics

Deployment + Ownership/Roles → governed by Policies and Approvals

Finding → tracked to Remediation → required to close Release Gate

Incident → triggers Runbook → yields Postmortem → updates Policies/Controls

10. Integration Taxonomy (Interfaces)

BCP ↔ GGP/GGE: approvals, policy enforcement, upgrade governance records

BCP ↔ IDN: identity/role attribution, signer mapping, accountability

BCP ↔ FLO: on-chain transaction feeds, reconciliation signals

BCP ↔ SIG: operational telemetry, alerts, anomaly feeds

BCP ↔ DRE: ecosystem intelligence, standards tracking, vendor assessments

BCP ↔ MUX: provider abstraction for RPC, indexing, custody, auditing vendors

NS-BCP-000 — CHARTER

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: BCP — Blockchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-BCP-000-CHARTER

Status: Draft v1

Canonical Template Alignment: NS-GGP 000–014

Owner: BCP Lead (TBD)

Custodian: NS Governance (GGP/GGE)

1. Purpose

BCP exists to provide a first-class, governed, and secure platform for building and operating:

Smart contracts (protocol and application contracts)

Decentralized applications (dApps) that interface with those contracts

ChainOps capabilities (deployments, monitoring, incident response)

On-chain state intelligence (indexing, event streams, analytics)

BCP transforms blockchain from “side projects” into a repeatable production capability: predictable delivery, strong security posture, auditable operations, and governed change control.

2. Mission

Make blockchain a safe, scalable, and productized capability inside Northfield Solidarity by:

Standardizing how contracts are designed, tested, deployed, upgraded, and monitored

Enforcing security and custody baselines by default

Enabling rapid dApp development with reusable modules and proven UX patterns

Integrating on-chain activity into NS’s broader operating system (governance, finance, identity, research)

3. Scope

3.1 In Scope

BCP owns the end-to-end lifecycle for blockchain delivery and operations:

A) Protocol & Contract Engineering

Contract architecture, implementation, and versioning

Standards adoption (e.g., ERC patterns) and internal libraries

Upgradeability and ownership models (where applicable)

B) dApp Product Development

Web/mobile dApp implementations

Wallet integrations and signing flows

Session/key UX patterns (e.g., account abstraction-ready approaches)

C) Security & Assurance

Threat modeling as a gating artifact

Code review, static analysis, fuzzing strategy

Audit readiness and vendor coordination

Security incident response (pause/rollback/communication procedures)

D) ChainOps & Infrastructure

CI/CD for contracts and dApps

Network environment management (dev/test/prod, testnets/mainnets)

RPC strategy, indexers, event ingestion pipelines

Observability: alerts, dashboards, runbooks

E) On-chain Data & Intelligence

Event indexing, subgraphs/indexers, analytics

Data products for internal engines (SIG/DRE/FLO/etc.)

3.2 Out of Scope (for v1)

Operating a Layer-1 blockchain network

Running a public validator business (unless explicitly chartered later)

Token issuance, treasury management, or protocol economics as a default activity

Note: these may be chartered later under governed vehicles and explicit approvals.

4. Non-Goals

BCP is explicitly not:

A replacement for NS governance (GGP/GGE)

A general-purpose web application team

An ad-hoc experimental playground without production discipline

A custody provider without strict policy and auditability

5. Operating Principles

5.1 Security First

“No secure deploy, no deploy.” Security gates are mandatory.

Defaults favor minimal privilege, hardened patterns, and reduction of blast radius.

5.2 Governed Change

Contract and protocol changes are governed changes, not casual code pushes.

Upgrade authority is explicit, documented, and reviewable.

5.3 Reusability & Standardization

BCP builds a library of primitives: modules, templates, and deploy scripts.

dApp patterns are standardized to reduce UX and security risk.

5.4 Observability by Default

Every production contract includes event strategy, monitoring, and runbooks.

On-chain signals are captured as first-class operational telemetry.

5.5 Progressive Decentralization (Optional)

Decentralization is treated as a roadmap outcome, not an immediate requirement.

Governance and control can shift over time under explicit approvals.

6. Core Deliverables (BCP v1)

BCP v1 must ship three platform deliverables to become “real”:

Contract Registry + Deployment Manager

Canonical inventory of contracts, networks, addresses, versions, configs

Deploy pipeline with approvals, provenance, and rollback/containment options

Security Baseline Kit

Mandatory artifacts: threat model template, audit checklist, upgrade policy

Standard roles/permissions patterns and emergency controls (pause/guardian)

dApp Starter Framework

Wallet integration toolkit + signing UX patterns

Indexing/data integration patterns for product teams

7. Governance & Gatekeeping

BCP introduces hard gates for production releases.

7.1 Required Release Gates (Minimum)

Threat model completed and reviewed

Test coverage + property tests/fuzzing baseline where appropriate

Static analysis results captured

Two-person peer review (at least 2 reviewers on critical changes)

Ownership / upgrade / pause model documented

Monitoring + alerts + runbook created

7.2 External Audit Policy (Principle)

High-risk or high-value contracts require external audit prior to mainnet deployment.

BCP manages audit readiness and remediation tracking.

7.3 Key Custody Policy (Day 1)

Key custody is policy-driven and auditable.

Default: multisig / MPC / hardware-backed custody patterns.

8. Interfaces to Other NS Engines

BCP is designed to integrate cleanly with NS’s engine ecosystem:

GGP / GGE (Governance): approvals, policy enforcement, upgrade decisions

IDN (Identity & Entity Nexus): actor/role mapping, ownership, permissions

FLO (Financial Ledger Orchestrator): on-chain accounting feeds and reconciliation

SIG (Signal Aggregation Engine): event streams and monitoring signals

DRE (Deep Research Engine): ecosystem tracking, chain standards, protocol intelligence

SIM (Simulation & Scenario Engine): risk modeling, scenario tests for upgrades/incidents

MUX (Market Integration Layer): integrating external providers (RPC, indexing, custodians)

9. Users & Stakeholders

Primary Users: BCP engineers, NS product teams building dApps, NS security function

Stakeholders: Governance (GGP/GGE), Finance (FLO), Identity (IDN), Research (DRE)

External Stakeholders (as applicable): audit firms, infrastructure providers, partners

10. Success Criteria

BCP is considered successful when:

NS can ship blockchain products predictably (repeatable pipelines, known gates)

Production contracts are secure-by-default (baselines, audits, monitoring)

Contract state and deployments are fully traceable (registry, provenance)

Incidents are manageable (pause/containment + runbooks + postmortems)

On-chain activity becomes a usable internal signal (feeds to SIG/FLO/DRE)

11. Risks & Mitigations (Charter-Level)

Security Risk: mitigated via mandatory gates, audits, custody policy

Operational Risk: mitigated via standardized deployment + observability

Regulatory/Compliance Risk: mitigated via explicit governance approvals and scoped activities

Vendor Risk (RPC/Indexing/Custody): mitigated via MUX-managed provider strategy and redundancy

12. Initial Constraints & Assumptions

Default chain strategy: EVM-first for v1 (broad tooling and ecosystem).

Other chains may be added via explicit roadmap items.

BCP will operate with a “production discipline” mindset from day one.

Token issuance and treasury operations are not part of v1 unless explicitly chartered.

13. Charter Commitments

By adopting this charter, Northfield Solidarity commits that:

Blockchain work is treated as production engineering with governance

Security and custody are non-negotiable baselines

BCP is the canonical home for smart contract lifecycle, ChainOps, and on-chain intelligence

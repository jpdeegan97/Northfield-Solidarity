NS-BCP-005 — DECISION

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: BCP — Blockchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-BCP-005-DECISION

Status: Draft v1

Depends On: NS-BCP-000-CHARTER, NS-BCP-001-OVERVIEW, NS-BCP-002-TAXONOMY, NS-BCP-003-ARCHITECTURE, NS-BCP-004-LIFECYCLE

Owner: BCP Lead (TBD)

1. Purpose

This document defines how BCP makes and records decisions that materially affect:

security posture

upgrade and governance authority

operational reliability

integration and vendor lock-in

BCP decisions are structured to be repeatable, auditable, and enforceable through policy gates.

2. Decision Framework

BCP uses a consistent framework for major decisions:

Decision Statement — what is being decided?

Context — why now? what constraints exist?

Options — at least 2 viable options (including “do nothing”)

Evaluation Criteria — security, operability, cost, time, ecosystem

Risk Class Impact — how does the system risk class change requirements?

Approval Path — who must approve (BCP, Security, GGP/GGE)?

Implementation Notes — how will this be enforced (policy, gates, runbooks)?

Record — decision ID, date, owners, and links to artifacts

3. Evaluation Criteria (Canonical)

All major decisions must be scored/considered against:

3.1 Security

attack surface (dependencies, upgradeability, privileged roles)

key custody and authority model

auditability and monitoring readiness

3.2 Operability

deployment complexity

incident response capability (containment)

observability and debugging quality

3.3 Ecosystem & Tooling

maturity of tooling (tests, debuggers, indexers)

audit talent availability

standard compatibility

3.4 Cost & Performance

transaction costs and UX impact

infra costs (RPC/indexing)

performance constraints (latency/throughput)

3.5 Governance Compatibility

alignment with GGP/GGE approvals and policy enforcement

ability to progressively decentralize if desired

4. Decision Domains

4.1 Chain Selection

BCP is EVM-first by default, but chain selection is a decision.

Options (typical):

EVM L2 (default for most apps)

EVM L1 (when required)

Alternative VM chains (Solana, Move chains, etc.)

When to deviate from EVM-first:

required ecosystem primitives exist only on a specific chain

performance/cost constraints cannot be met on EVM options

partner/customer requirement

Required artifacts:

chain selection memo

provider readiness (RPC/indexing/custody)

security review of tooling maturity

Approvals:

BCP Lead + BCP Security required

GGP/GGE required for High/Critical systems or any new chain introduction

4.2 Upgradeability Stance

Upgradeability is a high-impact decision. BCP supports:

Option A — Immutable Contracts

Pros: reduces privileged risk

Cons: harder to fix mistakes; may require migration

Option B — Upgradeable (Proxy/Controller)

Pros: patchability

Cons: introduces admin risk; requires stronger governance

Default guidance:

Low/Medium: prefer immutable where feasible

High/Critical: allow upgradeability only with:

timelock for upgrades

multisig/MPC custody

explicit emergency controls

comprehensive monitoring

Required artifacts:

upgrade policy (who/what/when/how)

rollback/containment plan

storage/layout compatibility plan (if proxy)

Approvals:

BCP Security + GGP/GGE for PROD upgrades and for High/Critical systems

4.3 Custody Pattern

Custody is non-negotiable for PROD privileged actions.

Patterns:

HSM-backed keys (centralized but hardened)

Multisig (M-of-N approvals)

MPC custody (distributed signing)

Defaults:

DEV: ephemeral keys permitted

TEST: limited keys, restricted permissions

PROD: multisig or MPC; no single hot key

Required artifacts:

custody design

key rotation and recovery plan

break-glass procedure

Approvals:

BCP Security required

GGP/GGE required for High/Critical custody changes

4.4 Permissioning Model (Roles)

BCP standardizes least-privilege roles.

Decisions include:

which functions are privileged

who holds admin/guardian roles

whether to use timelocks for sensitive actions

Required artifacts:

role/permission matrix

threat model mapping for privileged actions

Approvals:

BCP Security for all PROD

GGP/GGE for High/Critical

4.5 Observability Strategy

Decide how you will detect issues and prove system behavior.

Required decisions:

event schema design (what must be emitted)

indexing approach (subgraph/indexer)

alerting strategy (thresholds/anomaly)

Minimum baseline:

tx failure monitoring

critical event monitoring

indexer lag monitoring

runbook per system

4.6 Vendor Strategy (via MUX)

BCP should avoid single-provider fragility.

Decisions include:

RPC providers (primary + fallback)

indexing providers (or self-host)

custody provider selection

audit vendors

Required artifacts:

vendor assessment (SLA, reliability, cost, security)

redundancy plan

Approvals:

BCP Lead for Low/Medium

BCP Security + GGP/GGE for High/Critical or custody vendors

4.7 Release Gate Configuration

Release gates are policy decisions.

Decisions include:

test thresholds per risk class

fuzz/property requirements

when external audit is mandatory

Policy principle:

gates can be tightened, not weakened

any waiver must be explicit, time-bounded, and approved by governance

4.8 Data & Accounting Integration (FLO)

If contracts move value or represent assets, integration is required.

Decisions include:

which events constitute accounting primitives

reconciliation approach

attribution approach via IDN

Required artifacts:

event-to-ledger mapping

reconciliation runbook

5. Approval Matrix (v1)

5.1 Low Risk

Approvers: BCP Lead

Required: threat model lite, tests, monitoring baseline

5.2 Medium Risk

Approvers: BCP Lead + BCP Security

Required: full threat model, analysis results, runbook

5.3 High Risk

Approvers: BCP Lead + BCP Security + GGP/GGE

Required: fuzz/property tests, audit (recommended/likely), custody enforced

5.4 Critical Risk

Approvers: BCP Lead + BCP Security + GGP/GGE (mandatory)

Required: external audit, timelock upgrades, enhanced monitoring, staged rollout

6. Decision Records (BCP-ADR)

BCP maintains Architecture/Decision Records:

Format:

BCP-ADR-####

Title

Status: Proposed / Accepted / Superseded

Date

Context

Options

Decision

Consequences

Links: threat model, registry entries, runbooks

Where stored:

BCP decision registry (repo + index)

linked from Contract Registry entries

7. Default Decisions (v1 Baseline)

Unless overridden by an accepted ADR:

EVM-first chain strategy

prefer immutable contracts unless upgradeability is justified

PROD privileged actions require multisig/MPC/hardware-backed custody

High/Critical systems require incident-ready runbooks and strong monitoring

all PROD releases require policy gate pass + registry update

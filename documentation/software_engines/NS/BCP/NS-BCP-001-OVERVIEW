NS-BCP-001 — OVERVIEW

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: BCP — Blockchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-BCP-001-OVERVIEW

Status: Draft v1

Depends On: NS-BCP-000-CHARTER

Owner: BCP Lead (TBD)

1. Executive Summary

The Blockchain Compute Plane (BCP) is Northfield Solidarity’s standardized platform for building, deploying, and operating smart contracts and dApps with production-grade governance and security.

BCP converts blockchain work from “bespoke engineering” into a repeatable delivery system:

predictable environments (dev/test/prod)

controlled deployments with provenance

mandatory security gates and audit readiness

strong custody and access controls

observability and incident response by default

BCP is both:

a product studio capability (ship dApps and on-chain products)

a platform capability (shared primitives, pipelines, and controls)

2. What BCP Is

BCP is the canonical NS plane for:

2.1 Smart Contract Lifecycle

Design standards and contract architecture

Implementation, testing, and review

Deployment, upgrade governance, and change control

Post-deploy monitoring and incident response

2.2 dApp Delivery

Wallet integrations and signing flows

Frontend/mobile patterns for safe transaction UX

Integration with indexers and on-chain data sources

2.3 ChainOps

Environment management (testnets/mainnets)

CI/CD pipelines for contracts and apps

RPC and indexing strategy

Monitoring, alerting, runbooks

2.4 On-Chain Intelligence

Event ingestion → normalized signals → internal feeds

Analytics readiness for FLO, SIG, DRE, SIM and other NS systems

3. What BCP Is Not

BCP is not:

a governance authority (that’s GGP/GGE)

a generic webapp team (BCP dApp work is on-chain-integrated product work)

an experimental sandbox without controls (experimentation exists, but with clear separation and environment boundaries)

a token issuance engine by default (requires explicit governance and separate vehicles)

4. BCP Users

4.1 Primary Users

BCP Engineers: contracts, dApps, ChainOps

Product Teams: teams building NS products that need on-chain primitives

Security & Assurance: internal reviewers, audit coordinators, incident responders

4.2 Secondary Users

Governance (GGP/GGE): approvals, policy enforcement, upgrade decision tracking

Finance (FLO): on-chain accounting feeds, reconciliation, treasury visibility (if applicable)

Identity (IDN): roles, permissions, ownership mapping

Research (DRE): ecosystem tracking, standards monitoring, chain roadmap intelligence

5. Core Concepts

5.1 Networks & Environments

BCP explicitly separates environments:

DEV: rapid iteration, local forks/simulators

TEST: shared integration nets, staging configs, rehearsals

PROD: mainnet (or production-equivalent), strict gates

5.2 Contract Registry (Source of Truth)

BCP maintains an authoritative record for:

contract names, versions, bytecode provenance

deployment addresses per network

constructor/config parameters

ownership/upgrade authorities

linked runbooks and monitoring dashboards

5.3 Release Gates

BCP defines minimum required artifacts and checks before production deployment:

threat model + review

testing baseline (unit + property tests/fuzzing where applicable)

static analysis record

peer review (two-person rule for critical changes)

documented ownership/upgrade/pause model

monitoring + runbooks

5.4 Security & Custody

BCP treats keys and permissions as first-class:

explicit custody policy (hardware / MPC / multisig patterns)

least-privilege roles and break-glass controls

auditable approvals for high-impact actions

5.5 Observability

BCP requires that production systems:

emit events that support monitoring and forensics

flow into dashboards and alerts

have runbooks that describe triage and response steps

6. Reference Deliverables (BCP v1)

BCP v1 standardizes around three deliverables that every on-chain project can reuse:

Contract Registry + Deployment Manager

controlled deployments, provenance, environment configs

Security Baseline Kit

templates for threat modeling, upgrade policy, review checklist, incident response

dApp Starter Framework

wallet integration patterns, signing UX safety rails, indexing integration

7. How Work Flows Through BCP

A typical BCP project follows a repeatable path:

Intake / Intent

define objective, chain scope, risk class, and ownership

Design

architecture + threat model + upgrade/governance plan

Build

implement contracts and dApp; wire indexing and telemetry

Verify

tests + analysis + peer review; external audit if required

Deploy

staged rollouts; registry updates; approvals captured

Operate

monitor, respond, patch (via governed change)

Evolve

upgrades/migrations under governance; postmortems and pattern improvements

8. Interfaces with Other NS Engines

8.1 Governance (GGP/GGE)

approvals for production deployment and upgrades

policy enforcement (gates, required artifacts)

8.2 Identity (IDN)

mapping of human/agent identities to on-chain roles

access control and responsibility attribution

8.3 Finance (FLO)

ingestion of on-chain transactions and events for accounting/reconciliation

8.4 Signals (SIG)

monitoring feeds, anomalies, incident triggers

8.5 Research (DRE)

chain/standards intelligence; protocol watchlists; vendor assessments

8.6 Simulation (SIM)

scenario modeling for upgrades, incidents, liquidity/market interactions (if applicable)

8.7 Market Integration (MUX)

provider abstraction for RPC, indexing, custody, auditing vendors

9. Adoption Model

BCP is designed for incremental adoption:

Phase 1 (Foundation): registry + deploy manager + baseline security gates

Phase 2 (Scale): shared libraries, hardened dApp framework, stronger observability

Phase 3 (Maturity): advanced governance (timelocks, progressive decentralization), formal methods where needed, continuous audit posture

10. Key Decisions (v1 Defaults)

Chain strategy: EVM-first for v1 unless a project requires otherwise

Upgrades: allowed only with explicit documented model and governance approvals

Custody: multisig/MPC/hardware-backed patterns; no unmanaged hot keys

Release discipline: production deployments require the full gate set

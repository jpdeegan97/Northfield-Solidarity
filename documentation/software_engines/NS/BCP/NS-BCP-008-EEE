NS-BCP-008 — EEE (End-to-End Example)

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: BCP — Blockchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-BCP-008-EEE

Status: Draft v1

Depends On: NS-BCP-003-ARCHITECTURE, NS-BCP-004-LIFECYCLE, NS-BCP-007-DATAMODEL

Owner: BCP Lead (TBD)

1. Scenario

We will walk through an end-to-end BCP delivery loop for a simple but realistic system:

System: BCP-SYS-TreasuryVault

Purpose: hold and disburse funds under governed controls

Contracts: TreasuryVault, VaultPolicy (optional)

dApp: Treasury Console (admin UI)

Networks:

TEST: SEPOLIA

PROD: ARBMAIN (example)

Risk Class: HIGH (value custody + privileged controls)

2. Intake (Stage 0)

2.1 Inputs

“We need a treasury vault with controlled withdrawals and event visibility.”

2.2 Outputs

BCP System Brief

owner: IDN:NorthfieldSolidarityOps

value at risk: meaningful

primary actions: deposit, withdraw, role assignment, emergency pause

Classifications

risk class: HIGH

change class: MINOR (initial release planning)

Draft Ownership

Admin: multisig

Guardian: separate multisig (or limited admin)

Upgrades: timelock (if upgradeable)

2.3 Registry Entries (Created)

BCP_SYSTEM:

system_id = BCP-SYS-TreasuryVault

risk_class = HIGH

upgrade_stance = UPGRADEABLE (decision pending)

3. Design (Stage 1)

3.1 Key Decisions

Decision 1 — Upgrade stance

Option A: Immutable, migrate if needed

Option B: Upgradeable with timelock + multisig

Accepted (for this example): Option B

Rationale: treasury safety features may need patching; governance controls reduce risk

Decision 2 — Custody model

PROD privileged actions require multisig or MPC

3.2 Required Design Artifacts

Contract Spec (excerpt)

deposit() allows anyone to deposit

withdraw(to, amount) requires TREASURER role

setLimit(token, dailyLimit) requires POLICY_ADMIN

pause() requires GUARDIAN

unpause() requires ADMIN + timelock (optional)

Threat Model (excerpt)

Assets: funds in vault

Threats: compromised admin key; role abuse; re-entrancy; config manipulation

Mitigations:

multisig custody

role separation (treasurer vs policy admin)

timelock upgrades

reentrancy guards + checks-effects-interactions

emit events for all privileged actions

Ownership/Role Matrix

ADMIN: upgrades, role assignment

TREASURER: withdrawals (bounded by limits)

POLICY_ADMIN: limit configuration

GUARDIAN: pause

Event/Telemetry Plan

emit events:

Withdrawn(to, token, amount, by)

LimitChanged(token, newLimit, by)

Paused(by) / Unpaused(by)

RoleGranted(role, account, by)

3.3 Gate

threat model reviewed and marked APPROVED

4. Build (Stage 2)

4.1 Implementation

repo: repos/bcp/treasury-vault

packages:

BCP-CONTRACT-TreasuryVault

4.2 Tests

unit tests for role enforcement

property tests (invariants):

cannot withdraw when paused

withdrawals do not exceed configured limits

only authorized roles can change limits

4.3 Build Outputs

BCP produces:

ABI

bytecode

toolchain + dependency digests

4.4 Registry Entry (Build Artifact Set)

BUILD_ARTIFACT_SET:

artifact_set_id = ART-TreasuryVault-1.0.0-<digest>

bytecode_digests = [...]

abi_digests = [...]

5. Verify (Stage 3)

5.1 Automated Verification

static analysis completed

fuzzing run completed for invariants

coverage meets HIGH baseline

5.2 Human Review

two-person review complete

review notes resolved

5.3 Testnet Rehearsal

deploy to SEPOLIA via TEST signer

run operational rehearsal:

role assignments

withdraw flows

pause/unpause

5.4 External Audit (HIGH)

audit engagement created

findings tracked; all HIGH/CRITICAL findings remediated and verified

5.5 Gate

Release Ready after:

no open HIGH/CRITICAL findings

runbook complete

monitoring hooks validated on TEST

6. Release (Stage 4)

6.1 Release Manifest

release_id = BCP-REL-20251223-001

target network: ARBMAIN

package: TreasuryVault@1.0.0

config digest: CFG-<hash>

custody: multisig signer

6.2 Policy Checks

Required for HIGH:

threat model approved ✅

tests + analysis ✅

audit report linked ✅

runbook + monitoring ✅

custody enforced ✅

6.3 Governance Approval

GGP/GGE approves:

production deployment

authority set

upgrade timelock parameters

6.4 Deployment Execution

Release Orchestrator requests signature from multisig

tx submitted to chain

receipts captured

6.5 Registry Update

Create DEPLOYMENT:

deployment_id = BCP-DEPLOY-TreasuryVault-ARBMAIN-PROD#1

address = 0x...

tx_hash = 0x...

artifact_set_id = ART-TreasuryVault-1.0.0-<digest>

Create BCP_RELEASE and RELEASE_ITEM:

links approvals + manifests + validation

7. Operate (Stage 5)

7.1 Monitoring Live

SIG receives normalized signals:

withdrawal volume spikes

repeated reverts

pause status changes

Dashboards:

vault balance

withdrawals per day

limit configuration

indexer lag

7.2 Routine Operational Work

weekly review of privileged actions

check role bindings

verify custody health

7.3 Incident Example

Incident: unexpected withdrawal attempts failing repeatedly

detect: alert on revert spike

triage: identify caller address

contain: if suspicious, guardian pauses

recover: adjust policy and/or permissions

postmortem: update threat model and gates

8. Evolve (Stage 6)

8.1 Change Request

Goal: add support for ERC-4626 style deposits OR improve limit logic.

Classify:

change class: MINOR (or MAJOR if breaking)

risk class: HIGH (unchanged)

8.2 Process

update spec + threat model (new attack surface)

implement TreasuryVault@1.1.0

repeat verify steps

rehearse upgrade on TEST

obtain governance approval

execute upgrade under timelock

8.3 Upgrade Record

BCP-UPG-TreasuryVault-ARBMAIN-20260110-001

link:

pre-state deployment

post-state implementation

approvals

validation report

8.4 Registry Updates

update deployment record with new impl address (if proxy)

append upgrade event

9. What This Example Proves

BCP EEE demonstrates:

clear artifact trail (spec → build → deploy → operate)

mandatory gates tied to risk class

custody and approvals as first-class control points

registry as the canonical source of truth

operational readiness (signals, dashboards, runbooks)

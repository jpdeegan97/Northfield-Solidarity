Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM).
The taxonomy establishes a shared vocabulary for:
simulation artifacts
scenario structure
assumptions and constraints
variables and outputs
uncertainty and sensitivity constructs
The goal is to ensure that all simulations are comparable, explainable, and replayable across time, engines, and operators.
2. Taxonomy Design Principles
Explicit Assumptions — nothing is implicit
Separation of Reality vs Hypothesis — observed ≠ simulated
Non-Authoritative Outputs — simulations never assert truth
Deterministic Structure — same inputs → same outputs
Composable Units — scenarios are built from reusable parts
3. Core Artifact Classes
SIM defines six primary artifact classes:
Scenario
Assumption Set
Constraint Set
Variable
Outcome
Sensitivity Artifact
4. Scenario
Definition
A Scenario is a named, versioned container representing a modeled future.
Attributes
scenario_id
scenario_type
description
baseline_ref
created_at
created_by
ruleset_version
Scenario Types
baseline
optimistic
pessimistic
action_driven
stress_test
comparative
5. Assumption Set
Definition
An Assumption Set captures explicit hypotheses applied during simulation.
Categories
Market assumptions
Demand assumptions
Supply assumptions
Execution assumptions
Financial assumptions
Examples
demand_growth_rate = +12%
conversion_rate uplift = +1.5%
fulfillment_cost increase = +8%
Assumptions are first-class, versioned artifacts.
6. Constraint Set
Definition
A Constraint Set defines hard boundaries that simulations must respect.
Constraint Classes
Financial (capital limits, burn rates)
Operational (capacity, throughput)
Temporal (deadlines, seasonality)
Governance (approval gates, risk limits)
Constraints are enforced, not averaged.
7. Variables
Definition
Variables are quantities that change over time during simulation.
Variable Types
state variables (inventory level)
control variables (spend rate)
exogenous variables (market demand)
Variables reference:
initial state
update function
bounds
8. Outcomes
Definition
Outcomes represent modeled results produced by a simulation.
Outcome Classes
Financial outcomes (profit, cash flow)
Operational outcomes (throughput, SLA)
Risk outcomes (drawdown, failure probability)
Performance metrics (ROI, IRR)
Outcomes are time-series where applicable.
9. Uncertainty Model
Definition
Uncertainty captures variance in assumptions or variables.
Constructs
probability distributions
confidence intervals
stochastic perturbations
Uncertainty is explicit and never hidden.
10. Sensitivity Artifact
Definition
A Sensitivity Artifact identifies which assumptions or variables most influence outcomes.
Attributes
input_ref
outcome_ref
sensitivity_score
directionality
Used for risk awareness and decision support.
11. Baseline vs Variant Semantics
Baseline scenarios reference observed reality (SIG + FLO)
Variants override specific assumptions
All deltas are explicit and traceable
12. Cross-Engine References
Engine
Usage
SIG
Supplies observed signals & aggregates
PIE
Supplies insight candidates
DAT
Supplies execution parameters
FLO
Supplies financial constraints
GGP
Governs scenario usage
PTE
Compares outcomes vs reality
13. What SIM Does Not Taxonomize
SIM does not define:
execution steps (DAT)
approval semantics (GGP)
accounting truth (FLO)
SIM taxonomizes possibility, not action.

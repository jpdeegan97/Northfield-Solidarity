Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework for the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM).
SIM decisions are bounded, non-authoritative, and deterministic. They exist to:
determine whether a scenario can be constructed and executed
select applicable models and rulesets
enforce constraints during simulation
classify outcomes and risks
SIM decisions do not approve actions, allocate capital, or trigger execution.
2. Decision Design Principles
Bounded Authority — SIM decides how to simulate, not what to do
Determinism — identical inputs and versions yield identical decisions
Explainability — every decision emits a rationale artifact
Immutability — decisions are recorded, never overwritten
Governance-Aware — certain decisions require or reference GGP approval
3. Decision Classes
SIM defines six primary classes of decisions:
Scenario Admission Decisions
Input Resolution Decisions
Model Selection Decisions
Constraint Enforcement Decisions
Execution Control Decisions
Outcome Classification Decisions
Each decision produces a decision artifact.
4. Scenario Admission Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this scenario request valid and allowed to run?
Inputs:
initiator identity
scenario intent
referenced insight(s)
governance flags
Outcomes:
admit
reject
defer (await governance)
Admission never implies approval to act.
5. Input Resolution Decisions
Question Answered:
Are all referenced inputs resolvable and compatible?
Inputs:
SIG signal IDs + versions
PIE insight IDs + versions
DAT and FLO parameter versions
Outcomes:
resolved
unresolved (missing / incompatible)
Unresolved inputs block execution.
6. Model Selection Decisions
Question Answered:
Which simulation models and rulesets apply?
Inputs:
scenario type
domain (market, supply, finance)
model availability
Outputs:
model identifiers
model versions
Model selection is explicit and recorded.
7. Constraint Enforcement Decisions
Question Answered:
Do constraints permit continuation of simulation paths?
Inputs:
constraint sets
runtime variable states
Outcomes:
continue
halt path
annotate violation
Constraints stop simulated paths, not real actions.
8. Execution Control Decisions
Question Answered:
Should simulation execution continue, pause, or abort?
Triggers:
runtime errors
exceeded bounds
operator intervention
Outcomes:
continue
pause
abort
All outcomes are logged.
9. Outcome Classification Decisions
Question Answered:
How should results be classified for downstream use?
Classification Dimensions:
success / failure
risk tier
sensitivity concentration
Classifications are descriptive, not prescriptive.
10. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each SIM decision emits an immutable artifact containing:
decision_id (UUID)
decision_type
subject_ref (scenario, input, run)
outcome
rationale (structured)
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
evaluated_at
correlation_id
11. Governance Interaction
Some decisions may:
require GGP reference
be blocked pending approval
include governance context metadata
SIM does not bypass governance gates.
12. Failure Modes & Safeguards
Admission failures prevent execution
Input resolution failures halt construction
Model failures abort affected paths only
Partial results are preserved
Safety favors preservation and explainability.
13. Cross-Engine Interaction
Engine
Interaction
PIE
Supplies insight references
SIG
Supplies observed data
DAT
Supplies execution parameters
FLO
Supplies constraints
GGP
Governs usage and approvals

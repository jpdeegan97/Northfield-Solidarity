Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose
The Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM) is responsible for executing counterfactual reasoning, forward simulations, and scenario stress testing across the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
SIM exists to answer a core class of questions:
If we take a particular action (or take no action), what are the plausible outcomes across time, uncertainty, and constraints?
SIM does not decide what should be done and does not execute actions. Its sole responsibility is to model possible futures, make assumptions explicit, and quantify uncertainty so that humans and downstream engines can reason safely.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
SIM sits between insight generation and execution.
It primarily consumes:
PIE insights (candidate opportunities)
SIG signals and aggregates (observed reality)
FLO financial constraints and capital state
DAT execution parameters (channels, timing, costs)
It produces scenario artifacts consumed by:
GGP for governance review and approval gating
DAT for execution planning refinement
Humans for strategic and risk-aware decision-making
SIM converts opportunity into understood risk.
3. What SIM Produces
SIM produces Scenario Artifacts, which are structured, versioned representations of modeled futures.
Each scenario includes:
A clearly defined baseline
One or more variants (actions or shocks)
Modeled outcomes over time
Explicit uncertainty bands
Sensitivity analysis highlighting key drivers
Identified failure modes and breakpoints
SIM outputs are:
Non-authoritative
Explainable
Deterministic given identical inputs and versions
4. What SIM Does Not Do
To preserve system safety and clarity, SIM explicitly does not:
Approve actions or override governance (GGP)
Execute trades, listings, or campaigns (DAT)
Allocate or move capital (FLO)
Generate insights from raw data (PIE, SIG)
Manage identities, permissions, or entities (IDN, PECA)
SIM models possibilities — it does not choose or act.
5. Core Capabilities
SIM provides the following core capabilities:
Counterfactual Simulation
Evaluate alternative decisions against a shared baseline.
Scenario Construction
Combine signals, insights, and constraints into coherent futures.
Time-Series Projection
Project outcomes across configurable time horizons.
Uncertainty & Sensitivity Analysis
Quantify variance and identify critical assumptions.
Constraint Enforcement
Respect financial, operational, temporal, and governance limits.
Explainable Results
Every output includes assumptions, drivers, and confidence bounds.
6. Scenario Classes
SIM supports multiple scenario classes:
Baseline — continuation of observed reality
Optimistic / Pessimistic — bounded outcome extremes
Action-Driven — explicit execution proposals
Stress Test — adverse shocks and constraint pressure
Comparative — side-by-side evaluation of alternatives
7. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to SIM
SIG
Supplies observed signals and aggregates
PIE
Supplies insight candidates
DAT
Supplies execution parameters and costs
FLO
Supplies financial constraints and exposure
GGP
Governs scenario usage and approval
PTE
Compares simulated outcomes vs reality
SIM never bypasses governance or execution controls.
8. Operational Posture
SIM is:
Compute-heavy, write-light
Often batch-oriented, with optional on-demand runs
Replayable and deterministic
Suitable for both human-in-the-loop and automated pipelines
9. Expected Outcomes
When SIM is functioning correctly:
Risk is surfaced before capital is committed
Downside scenarios are explicit rather than implicit
Sensitivity and uncertainty are understood
Governance discussions are faster and better informed
SIM reduces surprise, not ambition.

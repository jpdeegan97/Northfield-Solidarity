Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the versioning model for the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM).
SIM versioning ensures that:
simulations are deterministic and reproducible
historical scenario results remain interpretable
model and assumption evolution never mutates past results
downstream engines can reason about scenario provenance safely
2. Versioning Principles
Results Are Immutable
Once a scenario run is persisted, it is never modified or deleted.
Logic Evolves, Not History
Models, assumptions, and constraints evolve via versioned artifacts.
Explicit Version Binding
Every scenario run records the exact versions of all inputs and logic used.
Replay Over Rewrite
Changes are applied by re-execution, never by mutation.
Forward Interpretability
Historical scenarios must remain readable and explainable.
3. Versioned Components in SIM

4. Versioning Scheme
SIM components follow semantic versioning:
MAJOR — breaking semantic change (interpretation changes)
MINOR — additive or tuning change
PATCH — bug fix with no semantic change
All versions are immutable once published.
5. Scenario-to-Version Binding
Each scenario run records:
scenario_definition_version
assumption_set_version(s)
constraint_set_version(s)
model_version(s)
execution_engine_version
random_seed
This guarantees full reproducibility.
6. Decision Artifact Version Binding
All SIM decisions (see NS-SIM-005) record:
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
rationale
This allows auditors to reconstruct why a scenario behaved as it did.
7. Model Evolution & Re-Execution
When models evolve:
existing scenario runs remain untouched
new executions reference updated versions
comparisons are made across runs, not within them
No scenario run is ever retroactively updated.
8. Replay Semantics
SIM supports two replay modes:
8.1 Deterministic Replay
Same inputs
Same versions
Same random seed
Identical outputs expected
8.2 Comparative Re-Execution
Same inputs
Different model or assumption versions
Used to evaluate impact of changes
9. Schema Evolution Rules
New optional fields may be added
Existing fields may not change meaning
Fields may be deprecated but not removed
Historical scenario artifacts must remain readable.
10. Cross-Engine Compatibility
Downstream engines rely on SIM to expose:
scenario_run identifiers
version metadata
confidence and uncertainty annotations
SIM guarantees version metadata is always present and queryable.
11. Failure & Rollback Strategy
Faulty versions are disabled, not deleted
Failed executions are preserved with status
Rollback is achieved by selecting prior versions
12. Document Position in SIM Corpus
This versioning document builds upon:
NS-SIM-003 — ARCHITECTURE
NS-SIM-004 — LIFECYCLE
NS-SIM-005 — DECISION
It informs:
NS-SIM-007 — DATAMODEL
NS-SIM-013 — RUNBOOK

Market Integration Layer (MUX)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework used by the Market Integration Layer (MUX).
MUX decisions determine:
whether external data is trusted enough to ingest
how duplicates are handled
when connectors are degraded or disabled
how replay, backfill, and reprocessing are performed
MUX does not decide business meaning, financial classification, or strategy. It decides external truth admissibility and integrity only.
2. Decision Design Principles
External Truth Supremacy — MUX reflects what external systems assert
Fail Closed on Trust — ambiguity blocks promotion, not capture
Deterministic Outcomes — same input + ruleset → same decision
Append-Only Effects — decisions never delete history
Governance Visibility — risky decisions are surfaced to GGP
3. Decision Categories
MUX decisions fall into six primary categories:
Connector Admission Decisions
Payload Trust & Integrity Decisions
Normalization Decisions
Deduplication Decisions
Publication Decisions
Replay & Backfill Decisions
Each decision produces a Decision Artifact.
4. Connector Admission Decisions
4.1 Connector Enablement Decision
Question: Should this connector be enabled?
Inputs:
connector configuration
credential validity
governance approval (if required)
Outcomes:
connector.enabled
connector.disabled
High-risk connectors require GGP approval.
4.2 Connector Degradation Decision
Question: Should this connector be degraded or disabled?
Triggers:
repeated auth failures
schema drift
excessive error rate
rate limit exhaustion
Outcomes:
connector.degraded
connector.disabled
5. Payload Trust & Integrity Decisions
5.1 Signature Verification Decision
Question: Is the payload authentic?
Outcomes:
payload.accepted
payload.rejected_invalid_signature
Rejected payloads are quarantined.
5.2 Integrity Hash Decision
Question: Has payload content been tampered with?
Outcomes:
integrity.valid
integrity.invalid
6. Normalization Decisions
6.1 Schema Mapping Decision
Question: Can this payload be mapped to a canonical artifact type?
Outcomes:
normalize.success
normalize.blocked_schema_unknown
Blocked payloads are retained for later reprocessing.
7. Deduplication Decisions
7.1 Artifact Deduplication Decision
Question: Is this artifact new or a duplicate?
Inputs:
source_system
external_id
integrity_hash
Outcomes:
dedupe.accept_new
dedupe.link_existing
Duplicates create reference links; they are not deleted.
8. Publication Decisions
8.1 Event Publication Decision
Question: Should this canonical artifact be published downstream?
Conditions:
integrity valid
normalization successful
Outcomes:
publish.allowed
publish.blocked
9. Replay & Backfill Decisions
9.1 Replay Authorization Decision
Question: Is replay allowed?
Inputs:
replay scope
requester identity
governance reference (if needed)
Outcomes:
replay.allowed
replay.denied
9.2 Backfill Execution Decision
Question: Should backfill be executed now?
Inputs:
connector health
requested time window
Outcomes:
backfill.allowed
backfill.deferred
10. Decision Artifacts
Each MUX decision produces a persisted artifact:
Decision Artifact Fields:
decision_id
decision_type
input_refs
outcome
rationale
ruleset_version
evaluated_at
actor_type (system / operator / governance)
correlation_id
Decision artifacts are immutable and replayable.
11. Determinism & Replay
Decisions are deterministic per ruleset version
Rule changes produce new decision artifacts
Historical decisions remain inspectable

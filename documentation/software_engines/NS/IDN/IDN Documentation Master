Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
Documentation Master Plan (Aligned to NS-GGP Canonical Template)
PurposeThis document defines the authoritative documentation master plan for IDN, strictly aligned to the existing NS-GGP document structure (000–014).
IDN is the identity resolution, entity graph, and trust anchor engine for Northfield Solidarity. It provides a canonical way to represent people, services, agents, organizations, and external accounts, and to reason about their relationships. IDN does not make business decisions (GGP), execute actions (DAT), or generate insights (PIE).

IDN Documentation Index (Canonical)

NS-IDN-000 — CHARTER
Purpose: Define why IDN exists
Scope:
Mission of IDN
Why identity and entity resolution must be centralized
IDN’s role as a trust anchor across engines
Explicit non-goals (business logic, execution, scoring)
Mirrors: NS-GGP-000

NS-IDN-001 — OVERVIEW
Purpose: High-level conceptual framing
Scope:
What IDN represents (entities, identities, relationships)
How IDN supports governance, audit, and execution
Downstream consumers: GGP, DAT, FLO, MUX, SIM
Mirrors: NS-GGP-001

NS-IDN-002 — TAXONOMY
Purpose: Define IDN’s atomic identity concepts
Scope:
Entity
Identity
Credential
Relationship
Trust Assertion

NS-IDN-003 — ARCHITECTURE
Purpose: Logical identity architecture
Scope:

Purpose: End-to-end identity lifecycle
Scope:
Identity creation
Verification

Mirrors: NS-GGP-004

NS-IDN-005 — DECISION
Purpose: Identity decision semantics

Purpose: Identity and entity versioning
Scope:
Versioning of identity assertions
Relationship changes over time
Historical correctness
Mirrors: NS-GGP-006

NS-IDN-007 — DATAMODEL
Purpose: Identity persistence and contracts
Scope:
Entity tables / graphs
Identity records
Credential storage
Replay assumptions
Mirrors: NS-GGP-007

NS-IDN-008 — EEE (End-to-End Example)
Purpose: Validate identity coherence
Scope:
New actor onboarding
Identity verification
Permission use in execution
Audit trail visibility
Mirrors: NS-GGP-008

NS-IDN-009 — IMPL
Purpose: Implementation blueprint
Scope:
MVP identity services
Resolution algorithms
Integration points
Mirrors: NS-GGP-009

NS-IDN-010 — FE / VISUALIZATION
Purpose: Identity visibility UX
Scope:
Entity graphs
Identity histories
Access views
Mirrors: NS-GGP-010

NS-IDN-011 — APIMAP
Purpose: API → identity surface mapping
Scope:
Identity APIs
Relationship queries
Trust assertion endpoints
Mirrors: NS-GGP-011

NS-IDN-012 — STATE
Purpose: Identity state semantics
Scope:
Active vs revoked identities
Consistency guarantees
Conflict resolution
Mirrors: NS-GGP-012

NS-IDN-013 — RUNBOOK
Purpose: Operational identity controls
Scope:
Credential rotation
Compromise response
Identity recovery
Mirrors: NS-GGP-013

NS-IDN-014 — DATADEF
Purpose: Canonical identity data definitions
Scope:
Entity schemas
Identity schemas
Relationship schemas
Mirrors: NS-GGP-014

Cross-Engine Dependencies
IDN integrates with but does not own:
GGP — authorization and governance
DAT — execution permissions
MUX — external credential use
FLO — financial attribution

Completion Criteria
IDN documentation is complete when:
NS-IDN-000 → NS-IDN-014 exist
Identity resolution is deterministic and auditable
Trust assertions are explicit and versioned
All engines reference identity consistently

Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose
The Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN) is the authoritative engine responsible for identity resolution, entity modeling, and relationship integrity across the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
IDN exists to answer a foundational question:
Who or what is acting, being acted upon, or being reasoned about — and how are those identities and entities related?
IDN provides canonical identity truth and entity graph coherence for all other engines.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
IDN sits at the foundational substrate layer of the system.
All engines depend on IDN for:
actor identity (human, system, agent)
entity identity (product, property, account, vendor, customer)
relationship resolution (ownership, control, attribution)
IDN does not make decisions, execute actions, or manage workflows. It supplies trusted identity context.
3. What IDN Produces
IDN produces Identity and Entity Artifacts, including:
Canonical Actor identities
Canonical Entity records
Relationship edges between entities
Resolution decisions (merge, split, alias)
Versioned identity states over time
All outputs are:
auditable
versioned
explainable
4. What IDN Does Not Do
To preserve clarity and safety, IDN explicitly does not:
authenticate users (delegated to auth systems)
authorize actions (GGP)
execute workflows (DAT, CWP)
store domain-specific business logic
IDN identifies; others decide and act.
5. Core Capabilities
IDN provides the following core capabilities:
Identity Resolution
Resolve multiple identifiers to a single canonical identity.
Entity Modeling
Represent real-world objects as stable entities.
Relationship Graph Management
Maintain typed, versioned edges between entities.
Alias & Merge Handling
Track historical merges, splits, and aliases.
Temporal Identity Tracking
Preserve identity state changes over time.
6. Identity & Entity Classes
IDN supports multiple classes:
Actors — humans, agents, services
Legal Entities — companies, trusts
Assets — products, properties, inventory units
Accounts — financial, platform, system accounts
Conceptual Entities — markets, regions, categories
7. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to IDN
GGP
Uses identity context for governance and audit
SIG
Attributes signals to entities and sources
PIE
Groups insights by entity
SIM
Binds scenarios to entities
DAT
Executes actions on behalf of entities
FLO
Tracks financial state per entity
PECA
Creates new property/legal entities
CWP
Manages agentic workers and roles
IDN is never bypassed for identity resolution.
8. Operational Posture
IDN is:
Write-controlled (governed merges/splits)
Read-heavy for downstream engines
Strongly consistent for identity truth
Replayable for audit
9. Expected Outcomes
When IDN is functioning correctly:
Identity ambiguity is eliminated or explicit
Entity relationships are transparent
Audit trails are complete and explainable
Downstream engines operate on shared truth
IDN reduces confusion, not flexibility.

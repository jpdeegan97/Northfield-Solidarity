Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the end-to-end lifecycle of identity and entity handling within the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
It specifies how:
identities and entities are created
identifiers are linked and resolved
relationships are added and evolved temporally
merges and splits occur (governed)
state is projected for fast consumption
replay and audit are supported
IDN lifecycle is designed to be auditable, deterministic, and governance-aware.
2. High-Level Lifecycle Stages
Identity/Entity Initiation
Validation & Canonical Creation
Identifier Linking & Resolution
Relationship Creation & Temporal Updates
Conflict Detection & Ambiguity Handling
Governed Merge/Split Operations
Projection Updates & Read Model Publication
Replay, Rebuild, and Audit
3. Stage 1 — Identity/Entity Initiation
Initiation sources include:
human operators
system services (SIG, DAT, FLO)
PECA entity creation flows
CWP agent/worker provisioning
Initiation always includes:
requested entity/actor type
initial identifiers (if available)
provenance (who/what initiated)
No identity is created without an initiator record.
4. Stage 2 — Validation & Canonical Creation
IDN validates:
required fields present
identifier formats
uniqueness constraints
lifecycle state compatibility
If valid:
assign canonical actor_id or entity_id
persist canonical registry record
emit IdentityCreated / EntityCreated event
Canonical creation is append-only.
5. Stage 3 — Identifier Linking & Resolution
IDN links identifiers to canonicals:
store identifier record
link to actor/entity
record confidence and issuing system
Resolution decisions determine whether:
identifier is safely attachable
ambiguity exists
conflict requires human/governance review
Events emitted:
IdentifierLinked
IdentifierUnlinked (rare; deprecated identifiers)
6. Stage 4 — Relationship Creation & Temporal Updates
IDN manages relationships as effective-dated edges.
Create relationship:
validate source/target existence
validate edge type
set effective window
persist relationship edge
emit RelationshipAdded
Update relationship:
close existing edge (effective_to)
create new edge
emit RelationshipRemoved + RelationshipAdded
Relationships evolve without mutation.
7. Stage 5 — Conflict Detection & Ambiguity Handling
Conflicts include:
identifier collision (same external ID linked to different canonicals)
relationship inconsistency (ownership loops, invalid edges)
duplicate entity suspicion
IDN responses:
flag ambiguity
quarantine resolution
require governed merge/split decision
No silent resolution occurs.
8. Stage 6 — Governed Merge/Split Operations
8.1 Merge
Used when two canonicals are determined to be the same.
Steps:
create merge request
attach evidence and rationale
obtain governance reference (if required)
perform merge event
update alias mappings
Result:
one surviving canonical
other becomes redirected/aliased
8.2 Split
Used when one canonical represents multiple real subjects.
Steps:
create split request
define resulting identities
reassign identifiers and relationships
emit split event
All operations are evented and auditable.
9. Stage 7 — Projection Updates & Read Model Publication
Projections maintained:
identifier → canonical lookup
canonical → identifiers list
adjacency/relationship indexes
Projection updates occur:
synchronously (MVP) or asynchronously (later)
Projections are rebuildable from the event ledger.
10. Stage 8 — Replay, Rebuild, and Audit
IDN supports:
Replay
rebuild identity state from events
verify determinism
Rebuild
regenerate projections
Audit
trace any canonical to:
creation event
identifier history
merge/split rationale
relationship evolution
No audit depends on implicit state.
11. Failure Handling
Failures may include:
invalid identifiers
constraint violations
projection rebuild errors
Handling:
reject invalid writes
preserve failed operations as decision artifacts
allow retry after correction
Identity truth is never partially mutated.
12. Cross-Engine Lifecycle Coordination
Engine
Interaction
GGP
governance approvals for merge/split and audit usage
SIG
attributes signals to entities
PIE
consumes entity grouping
SIM
binds scenarios to entities
DAT
executes on behalf of entities
FLO
accounts by entity
PECA
creates new legal/property entities
CWP
provisions agentic actors

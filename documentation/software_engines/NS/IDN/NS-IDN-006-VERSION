Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the versioning and evolution model for the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
IDN versioning ensures that:
identity truth is stable and interpretable over time
historical identity states are never rewritten
merges, splits, and relationship changes are explainable
downstream engines can safely reason about identity provenance
2. Versioning Principles
Identity History Is Immutable
Once an identity state or event is recorded, it is never altered or deleted.
Evolution via Events
Changes occur through versioned events, not record mutation.
Temporal Truth
Identity meaning is time-aware; "current" is a projection, not a rewrite.
Deterministic Replay
Replaying the same events yields the same identity graph.
Forward Interpretability
Historical identity states remain readable as schemas evolve.
3. Versioned Components in IDN
The following components are versioned:
Component
Versioned
Notes
Canonical actor records
Yes
Via creation + lifecycle events
Canonical entity records
Yes
Via creation + lifecycle events
Identifier links
Yes
Link/unlink events
Relationships
Yes
Effective-dated edges
Resolution logic
Yes
Ruleset versions
Decision logic
Yes
Decision rulesets
Projections
Yes
Rebuildable views
4. Event Versioning Model
IDN uses event-sourced versioning.
Each identity event records:
event_id
event_type
subject_ref
payload
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
occurred_at
Events are append-only and ordered.
5. Canonical Identity Versioning
Canonical identities do not change directly.
Instead:
lifecycle changes are recorded as events
identifiers are linked/unlinked via events
relationships evolve via effective-dated edges
A "version" of an identity is defined as the state resulting from replaying events up to a given time.
6. Merge & Split Version Semantics
6.1 Merge
Merge creates a new resolution event
One canonical becomes the survivor
Others become aliases with redirect metadata
Historical references remain valid
6.2 Split
Split creates new canonicals
Identifiers and relationships are reassigned via events
Original canonical remains in history
No merge or split erases history.
7. Relationship Versioning
Relationships are versioned by time:
effective_from
effective_to
Changes:
close existing edge
open new edge
This preserves full relationship evolution.
8. Schema Evolution Rules
New optional fields may be added
Existing fields may not change meaning
Deprecated fields remain readable
Schema migrations must preserve historical readability.
9. Downstream Compatibility Guarantees
IDN guarantees that:
canonical IDs remain stable
alias resolution remains queryable
event history remains accessible
Downstream engines should:
store ID references, not identity snapshots
10. Replay & Rebuild Semantics
IDN supports:
Replay
rebuild identity graph from events
validate determinism
Rebuild
regenerate projections and indexes
Replay never mutates historical records.
11. Failure & Rollback Strategy
Faulty ruleset versions are disabled
Incorrect events are compensated with new events
No hard deletes or rewrites

NSDC Engine Charter — IDN (Identity & Entity Nexus)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Identity & Entity Nexus
Acronym: IDN
Engine Type: Identity / Entity Management / Canonical Reference
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to maintain canonical identity, entity, and relationship records across NSDC, providing a single source of truth for all actors, assets, and organizational structures.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Maintain canonical records of entities, users, accounts, and organizational structures
  Track relationships and ownership hierarchies between entities and assets
  Provide unique identifiers and references for NSDC engines
  Serve as a reference point for governance, execution, and analytics engines
  Maintain historical snapshots of entity state for auditability
  Ensure consistency of identity data across all NSDC systems
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Execute trades or arbitrage (DAT)
  Govern capital or compliance (GGP)
  Generate product or market intelligence (PIE)
  Publish content or manage engagement (CDE)
  Maintain financial ledgers (FLO)
IDN provides canonical identity; it does not perform operations.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
IDN May Decide Autonomously:
  Assign and maintain unique identifiers
  Track and enforce entity hierarchies
  Validate consistency of identity data across engines
IDN Must Not Decide:
  Execution of trades or capital deployment
  Governance or policy enforcement outside reference
  Product, content, or market strategy decisions
IDN is the canonical reference system, not a decision-making engine.
8. Governance & Constraints
  All entity modifications must comply with GGP rules
  Historical state must be versioned and immutable
  Referential integrity must be maintained across NSDC engines
  Access controls and permissions must be enforced for entity modifications
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Duplicate or conflicting identifiers
  Relationship hierarchy inconsistencies
  Delays in entity propagation
Worst-Case Failure:
  Downstream engines receive inconsistent identity data, leading to operational errors
  Potential audit or compliance issues
Blast Radius:
  Primarily impacts governance (GGP), execution (DAT), and financial tracking (FLO)
  Does not directly cause financial loss
Containment strategy:
  Validation and reconciliation of entity IDs
  Versioned snapshots and rollback
  Alerts for inconsistencies
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Accuracy, uniqueness, and consistency of identity data
  Time Horizon: Continuous real-time reference with historical state available for audits
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Unique entity IDs
  Canonical asset and account references
  Relationship and hierarchy schemas
  Historical snapshot records
  Governance flags and permissions (GGP)
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Creation and maintenance of unique entity identifiers
  Tracking entity relationships and ownership hierarchies
  Historical snapshots for auditing
  Real-time reference API for NSDC engines
MVP Excludes:
  Execution, capital deployment, or trading
  Product or market intelligence generation
  Content distribution
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Core entity creation, hierarchy mapping, and reference API
  Phase 2: Integration with all NSDC engines and audit-ready versioning
  Phase 3: Advanced relationship modeling and dynamic entity analytics

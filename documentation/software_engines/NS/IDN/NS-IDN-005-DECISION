Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework for the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
IDN decisions are narrowly scoped, deterministic, and non-executing. They exist to:
determine how identities and entities are created, resolved, and related
evaluate identifier conflicts and ambiguity
govern merge and split operations
preserve explainability and auditability
IDN decisions never authorize business actions or workflows.
2. Decision Design Principles
Bounded Authority — IDN decides identity truth, not behavior
Determinism — identical inputs yield identical decisions
Explainability — every decision emits a rationale artifact
Immutability — decisions are recorded, never overwritten
Governance Awareness — certain decisions require explicit approval
3. Decision Classes
IDN defines six primary classes of decisions:
Canonical Creation Decisions
Identifier Linking Decisions
Conflict Detection Decisions
Relationship Validation Decisions
Merge Decisions
Split Decisions
Each decision produces a decision artifact.
4. Canonical Creation Decisions
Question Answered:
Should a new actor or entity be created?
Inputs:
initiation request
initial identifiers
provenance
Outcomes:
create canonical
reject (invalid or duplicate)
defer (await clarification)
5. Identifier Linking Decisions
Question Answered:
Can this identifier be safely linked to a canonical identity?
Inputs:
identifier type and value
issuing system
confidence score
existing links
Outcomes:
link
quarantine (ambiguous)
reject (conflict)
No identifier is silently reassigned.
6. Conflict Detection Decisions
Question Answered:
Does this operation introduce ambiguity or inconsistency?
Triggers:
identifier collision
relationship loops
duplicate entity suspicion
Outcomes:
allow
flag ambiguity
require merge/split evaluation
7. Relationship Validation Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this relationship valid and allowable?
Inputs:
relationship type
source and target types
temporal window
Outcomes:
allow
reject
Relationships are never inferred.
8. Merge Decisions
Question Answered:
Should two canonicals be merged?
Inputs:
evidence set
overlapping identifiers
relationship overlap
governance reference (if required)
Outcomes:
approve merge
reject merge
defer (await governance)
Merge decisions produce redirect and alias artifacts.
9. Split Decisions
Question Answered:
Should a canonical be split into multiple identities?
Inputs:
ambiguity evidence
proposed split plan
Outcomes:
approve split
reject split
defer
Splits reassign identifiers and relationships explicitly.
10. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each IDN decision emits an immutable artifact containing:
decision_id (UUID)
decision_type
subject_ref (actor/entity/relationship)
outcome
rationale (structured)
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
evaluated_at
correlation_id
11. Governance Interaction
Certain decisions:
merges
splits
high-impact relationship changes
may require:
GGP reference
explicit approval
IDN never bypasses governance gates.
12. Failure Modes & Safeguards
Invalid input → reject without mutation
Ambiguity → quarantine and flag
Governance denial → preserve request and rationale
Identity truth is never partially applied.
13. Cross-Engine Interaction
Engine
Interaction
GGP
governance approvals and audit
SIG
identity attribution
PIE
entity grouping
SIM
scenario binding
DAT
execution attribution
FLO
financial accounting by entity
PECA
entity creation
CWP
actor provisioning

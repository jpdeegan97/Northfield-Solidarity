NS Legal Pack v1 — US Operating Model (Entity Tree + Docs)

Not legal advice. This is a lawyer-ready draft documentation system (with key template language) that you can hand to counsel to finalize based on jurisdictions, licenses, compliance, and your actual operations.

0) Entity Tree (Canonical)

Northfield Solidarity LLC (HoldCo / Parent)

Owns membership interests in all subsidiaries

Holds founder/member equity + governance controls

Ideally does not sign customer contracts (keeps liability isolated)

→ South Lawn LLC (Facilities / Real Estate / Space)

Holds or leases physical space and facilities contracts

Leases office/facility use to sister entities via intercompany lease

→ NSDC Operations LLC (s) (Customer-facing Operating Company)

Signs customer contracts: Terms, Order Forms, DPA, SLA

Runs: billing, support, service delivery, customer success

Holds: operational vendor contracts (hosting, support, general ops)

(Optional later split)

NSDC Marketplace Ops LLC: merchant tools, payments rails, marketplace policies, disputes/chargebacks

NSDC Logistics Ops LLC: shipping/fulfillment, warehousing, carrier contracts, physical-liability vendor agreements

→ NSDC IP Holdings LLC (IPCo / IP Owner)

Owns: codebase, workflows, docs, templates, trademarks, domains, proprietary datasets (as applicable)

Licenses platform IP to NSDC Operations LLC (and/or Marketplace/Logistics entities)

→ NSDC Innovations Lab LLC (R&D that will ship)

Prototyping + product research

Assigns all resulting IP to NSDC IP Holdings LLC

→ NSDC Experimental Lab LLC (Higher-risk R&D / sandbox)

Bleeding-edge experiments, potentially higher compliance risk

Assigns IP to NSDC IP Holdings LLC subject to internal gate/review

→ NS MGMT LLC (Optional) (Shared Services / People Ops Wrapper)

Use only if you want centralized employment/contractors + shared services

Charges sister entities via intercompany services + cost allocation schedule

4) Internal Governance Pack (Per Entity)

For each LLC in the tree:

Delaware LLC Operating Agreement (single-member, manager-managed)

Initial Written Consent of Sole Member (organizational resolutions)

Entity Register (EIN, bank, accounting profile, signatory policy)

Default ownership: Sole Member = Northfield Solidarity LLC for all subs.

5) Intercompany Agreements (Core “Glue”)

5.1 IP Flow: Labs → IP Holdings

IP Assignment Agreement (Innovations Lab → IP Holdings)

Assign all inventions, code, docs, designs, datasets, workflows created in scope

Further assurances + moral rights waiver

IP Assignment Agreement (Experimental Lab → IP Holdings)

Same as above, with optional internal gate language (assignment occurs upon acceptance into IP Holdings repository)

5.2 Commercialization: IP Holdings → Operations

IP License Agreement (IP Holdings → NSDC Operations LLC)

Rights to host/operate/sublicense solely to provide the Service

Improvements clause: Ops improvements assigned to IP Holdings; Ops receives operational license-back

Royalty/fee: nominal or structured (rev % / cost-plus)

5.3 Shared Work: Services / Chargebacks

Choose one model:

Model A (No MGMT LLC):

Operations provides shared services (IT/SecOps/DevOps/Admin) to Labs

Labs provide R&D outputs; IP assigned to IP Holdings

Model B (With NS MGMT LLC):

MGMT employs people + provides shared services to all entities

Intercompany Services Agreements + cost allocation schedule

5.4 Facilities: South Lawn → Others

Intercompany Lease Agreement (South Lawn → Ops/Labs)

Rent, utilities allocation, insurance, indemnities, use restrictions

5.5 One-page Cost Allocation Schedule

Supports clean accounting and future audits

6) People & Vendor Templates (Pick contracting entity intentionally)

Mutual NDA (Ops or IP Holdings depending on purpose)

Independent Contractor Agreement (must include IP assignment + confidentiality)

Employee PIIA (invention assignment + confidentiality; jurisdiction-specific carve-outs)

Recommendation:

Contractors building core platform IP: contract via NSDC IP Holdings LLC (or ensure assignment flows to IP Holdings).

Customer success/support: contract via NSDC Operations LLC.

7) When to Split Ops into Marketplace + Logistics

Split when either becomes true:

You handle payments/merchants/disputes/chargebacks → Marketplace Ops

You handle physical custody/shipping/fulfillment liability → Logistics Ops

Add-on docs when you split:

Merchant/Marketplace Terms + dispute policy

Logistics terms, carrier/vendor indemnity clauses, loss/damage policy

8) Offshore Roadmap (Future — Cayman LLC / Cook Islands Trust)

Future intent (not executed in v1):

Plan to add a Cayman Islands entity and a Cook Islands trust structure later.

For now, operate under the US model above.

Implementation note:

When you’re ready, we’ll add a dedicated “Offshore Layer” section defining:

ownership/beneficiary relationships

IP licensing or holding strategy

controlled foreign corporation (CFC) considerations and reporting obligations

banking, substance, and governance requirements

(These topics are highly fact- and jurisdiction-dependent and should be finalized with qualified counsel.)

9) v1 Execution Order (Minimum Viable Legal)

Phase 1 (must-have):

Operating Agreements + Initial Consents for HoldCo, Ops, IP Holdings, Labs

IP Assignment: Innovations/Experimental → IP Holdings

IP License: IP Holdings → Operations

Customer stack: TOS + AUP + Privacy + Order Form

Phase 2 (as soon as relevant):
5) DPA + Security Addendum + SLA
6) Contractor/Employee agreements
7) South Lawn lease (when space is used)

Phase 3 (later):
8) Marketplace/Logistics split + addenda
9) Offshore layer (Cayman/Cook)

Legal Roadmap — 12 Months (US-first, Offshore-ready)

Objective: By the end of 12 months, Northfield Solidarity has a defensible multi-entity structure with clean IP chain-of-title, standardized customer contracts, operationally accurate privacy/security posture, and an “offshore-ready” binder for future Cayman LLC + Cook Islands trust implementation.

Stand up membership ledger + authority matrix (who can sign what)

Execute:

Labs → IP Holdings IP Assignments (both labs)

Month 10 — Governance Tightening (Process + Authority)

Goal: Governance becomes repeatable and auditable.

Quarterly manager resolutions cadence

Delegation of authority (spend/sign limits)

Goal: Be ready to implement offshore later without rework.

Assemble binder:

membership ledger/cap table

IP chain of title

intercompany agreements

financial statements + basic transfer pricing inputs

Operating Principles

Ops sells. IP holds. Labs create. HoldCo owns.

Every creator assigns IP upstream.

Intercompany money flows are documented (services + license + lease).

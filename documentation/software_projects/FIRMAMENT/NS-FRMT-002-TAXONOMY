NS-FIRMAMENT-002 — TAXONOMY

Project: Firmament (3D Operations Globe)Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)Authority: GGE (Governance Graph Engine)Status: Draft v0.1

1. Purpose

This taxonomy defines the canonical vocabulary, object classes, and relationships used by Firmament to render operations, strategy, and scenarios as layered, filterable overlays on a 3D Earth.

Firmament’s taxonomy is render-first: every concept below must be representable as a layer, a feature on the globe, a drilldown panel, and/or an actionable item routed into CWP and governed by GGE.

2. Primary Taxonomy Domains

Firmament is organized into 8 domains:

World Model (Earth, coordinates, zoom, regions)

Layers & Rendering (how things appear)

Entities & Relationships (who/what exists)

Operations & Logistics (flows and dependencies)

Time & Events (what happens when/where)

Sectors & Performance (health, KPIs, heatmaps)

Signals, Risks, Opportunities (what matters)

Actions, Plans, Governance (what to do next)

3. World Model

3.1 GeoReference

A canonical location reference.

Types: Point, Line, Polygon, MultiPolygon

Fields: lat, lon, alt (optional), geohash (optional), region_id (optional)

3.2 Region

Named spatial containers used for aggregation and filtering.

Types: Country, State/Province, Metro, Port, TradeZone, CustomRegion

Fields: region_id, name, geometry, hierarchy_path

3.3 ZoomContext

Defines what “level of detail” should be shown.

Levels (example): Global → Continental → National → Metro → Site → Facility

Behavior: layer visibility and feature density adapt by zoom.

4. Layers & Rendering

4.1 Layer

A coherent overlay on the globe or companion panels.

Layer Types:

PinsLayer (points)

RegionsLayer (polygons)

HeatLayer (tiles/choropleth/intensity)

TreemapLayer (sector heatmap panel)

TimelineLayer (time-filtered overlays)

Layer Properties: visibility, filters, legend, style_rules, drilldown_schema

4.2 Feature

A renderable instance within a layer.

Feature Types: Pin, Path, Polygon, HeatCell, TreemapTile

Feature Properties: feature_id, geometry, style, payload_ref, severity (optional)

Fields: flow_id, from, to, route, carrier (optional), SLA, status

6.2 Shipment (Physical Subtype)

States: Planned → Booked → InTransit → Delayed → Delivered → Exception

KPIs: ETA variance, cost variance, reliability score, risk score

6.3 Operational State

Normalized state markers for features/entities.

States: Green, Watch, AtRisk, Failing, Blocked

Purpose: consistent coloring/priority across layers.

7. Time & Events

7.1 Event

A time-bounded item tied to a location and stakeholders.

Event Types: Meeting, Conference, SiteVisit, ShipmentMilestone, Launch, Deadline, AuditGate

Fields: event_id, time_window, geo_ref, linked_entities[], agenda/checklist_ref, readiness_state

7.2 Timeline Window

A filterable time scope.

Modes: Now, Next 7 Days, Next 30 Days, Quarter, Custom

7.3 Readiness

Event preparedness scoring.

States: Unplanned, Planning, OnTrack, AtRisk, Ready

Computed From: checklist completion, owner assignment, dependencies cleared.

8. Sectors & Performance (Heatmap Domain)

8.1 Sector

A canonical category for business exposure/strategy (e.g., Technology, Financial Services).

Fields: sector_id, name, weight, benchmark_refs (optional)

8.2 Sector Metric

A metric computed per sector (Firmament can show many, not just returns).

Examples: Revenue, Margin, Pipeline, DemandSignals, FulfillmentReliability, RiskExposure

Field: metric_id, definition, source_engine, update_frequency

8.3 Sector Health Score

A normalized score for sector operating state.

Range: 0–100 (or -1..+1)

Inputs: weighted KPIs + signal severity + open blockers + scenario posture

8.4 TreemapTile

A sector’s render unit in the heatmap panel.

Size Encoding: sector weight (or chosen metric)

Color Encoding: selected performance metric (day/YTD/health score)

8.5 Sector Operating Brief

A structured drilldown product.

Sections:

What’s Going Well

What’s Failing

Root Causes (ops/finance/supply/market)

Immediate Actions

Strategic Moves

Governance Gates

Scenario Sensitivity (how slider changes priorities)

9. Signals, Risks, Opportunities

Status: Proposed, Approved, InProgress, Blocked, Done, Abandoned

10.2 PlanMode (Risk/Ambition Slider)

A posture selector that changes assumptions and priorities.

Modes: Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive (or continuous 0–100)

10.4 Governance Gate

A required decision checkpoint enforced by GGE.

Gate Types: BudgetApproval, VendorApproval, LegalReview, SecurityReview, StrategicApproval

Outputs: decision record, rationale, constraints, audit trail

11. Canonical Relationships (Cross-Domain)

These are the core edges Firmament must support:

Layer CONTAINS Feature

Feature REFERENCES (Entity | Event | Flow | Sector | Risk | Opportunity)

Entity LOCATED_AT GeoReference

Event OCCURS_AT GeoReference

Flow CONNECTS Entity → Entity

Signal AFFECTS (GeoScope, SectorScope, EntityScope)

Sector HAS_METRICS SectorMetric[]

Sector PRODUCES SectorOperatingBrief

SectorOperatingBrief RECOMMENDS ActionItem[]

ActionItem OWNED_BY CWP.Role/Actor

ActionItem GOVERNED_BY GGE.Gate (optional)

PlanMode MODIFIES (Scenario assumptions, Action priorities, Risk tolerances)

12. Naming Conventions

IDs are globally unique: firm_* optional prefix for Firmament-native objects.

Use stable canonical names for sectors (source: your internal taxonomy; mapped to external standards if desired).

All features must be resolvable to a payload_ref for drilldowns (no “dead geometry”).

13. Taxonomy Guarantees

Firmament must guarantee:

Every renderable thing maps to a typed object.

Every drilldown produces actions.

Every important action can be governed.

Every layer is filterable by time, geo, and relevance.

Every sector view can shift under plan modes (slider).

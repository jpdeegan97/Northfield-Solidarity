NS-FIRMAMENT-005 — DECISION

Project: Firmament (3D Operations Globe)Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)Authority: GGE (Governance Graph Engine)Status: Draft v0.1

1. Purpose

This document defines how Firmament supports and enforces decision-making across Northfield Solidarity by:

turning observations (layers/heatmaps/signals) into decision candidates,

routing meaningful moves through GGE governance gates,

assigning execution through CWP,

and maintaining a complete decision trace (inputs → rationale → approval → execution → outcome).

Firmament is a decision cockpit, not a governance authority. GGE remains authoritative.

2. Decision Philosophy

Firmament decisions follow four principles:

Observe → Explain → Act: no action without a clear brief.

Gates scale with impact: higher impact = higher governance.

Every decision is traceable: inputs and rationale are always recorded.

Outcomes close the loop: decisions are evaluated and feed future recommendations.

3. Decision Classes

Firmament classifies decisions to determine workflow, required evidence, and gating.

3.1 Class A — Routine Operational

Examples: minor reroutes, small procurement, schedule adjustments

GGE Gate: optional (policy-based)

Owner: CWP operator

Evidence: minimal (context + reason)

3.2 Class B — Material Operational

Examples: switching 3PL, rebalancing inventory posture, changing supplier terms

GGE Gate: required if above thresholds

Owner: assigned role + reviewer

Evidence: brief + constraints + risk assessment

3.3 Class C — Strategic Move

Examples: entering a new region, launching a product line, major partnership

GGE Gate: required

Owner: leadership role(s)

Evidence: scenario comparison + financial exposure + risk controls

3.4 Class D — Emergency / Incident

Examples: disruption response, supply shock, compliance incident

GGE Gate: expedited gate (emergency policy)

Owner: incident commander (CWP)

Evidence: signal bundle + mitigation plan + postmortem requirement

4. Decision Triggers (How a Decision Starts)

A decision candidate can be created from:

4.1 User Trigger

clicking a sector tile in the heatmap

selecting an alert hotspot

opening an event readiness panel

focusing a region and requesting “recommended actions”

4.2 System Trigger

SIG severity crossing threshold

sector health score drop

repeated SLA breaches on a flow

budget exposure crossing bounds (FLO)

scenario drift against plan

5. Decision Artifacts

Firmament produces structured artifacts (Firmament-native) which are then handed off to GGE/CWP.

5.1 Context Selection

Defines the scope of the decision.

geo_scope (viewport/region/site)

time_window

sector_scope

entities_in_scope[]

signals_in_scope[]

5.2 Operating Brief

Explains the situation.

what’s going well / failing

root causes (ops/finance/supply/market)

constraints (budget, capacity, policy)

confidence + staleness

5.3 Action Candidates

Ranked list of potential moves.

impact score

urgency

dependencies

cost estimate + risk estimate

recommended owner role

recommended gate type

5.4 Decision Packet (for GGE)

The canonical unit submitted to GGE.

title + description

decision class

scope + assumptions

evidence bundle

scenario comparison (if applicable)

requested approvals (gate)

rollback plan (required for higher classes)

6. Governance Gates (GGE Integration)

Firmament never “approves” decisions. It routes decisions into GGE.

6.1 Gate Selection Rules

Gate selection is determined by:

action impact score

dollar exposure (FLO)

compliance/security flags

strategic category

plan mode aggressiveness

6.2 Common Gate Types

BudgetApproval

VendorApproval

LegalReview

SecurityReview

StrategicApproval

EmergencyApproval

6.3 Gate SLA

Each gate has an expected SLA and escalation path. Firmament must display:

current gate state

reviewers

time remaining

blockers

7. Ownership and Execution (CWP Integration)

Every approved decision must translate to execution:

7.1 Task Instantiation

each action becomes one or more CWP tasks

tasks must include: owner, due date, dependencies, success criteria

7.2 Accountability Views

Firmament shows:

who owns what

what is blocked

what is overdue

readiness scores (for events and missions)

8. Plan Slider as Decision Modifier

The Risk ↔ Ambition slider changes:

KPI weighting

acceptable risk tolerance

speed vs certainty preference

governance strictness (more aggressive often implies more gating)

8.1 Scenario Bundle

When SIM is available, Firmament attaches:

scenario assumptions

projected outcomes

confidence band

sensitivity (what variables change the result)

If SIM is unavailable, Firmament still provides:

policy-weighted ranking changes

explicit “scenario unavailable” marker

9. Decision Traceability (Audit Model)

Firmament maintains links (not authority) to ensure trace completeness.

9.1 Required Trace Fields

source_feature_id / sector_id

input_refs[] (signals, KPIs, events, flows)

brief_id

plan_mode

scenario_id (optional)

action_ids[]

cwp_task_ids[]

gge_decision_id (optional/required)

outcome_metrics[]

9.2 Trace Completeness Score

Firmament displays a score for every major move:

missing evidence

missing owner

missing gate

missing success criteria

missing verification

10. Verification and Post-Decision Review

After execution, Firmament triggers review:

10.1 Outcome Check

KPI deltas vs baseline

risk reduction achieved?

cost variance vs estimate

timeliness (met SLA?)

10.2 Postmortem Requirements

For Class C/D moves, a postmortem is required:

what happened

what we learned

what to change in rules/models

11. Failure Modes and Safeguards

Stale inputs: decision packet must include staleness flags

Over-automation: high-impact actions cannot auto-execute; must gate

Ambiguous ownership: no action can leave Firmament without a proposed owner or explicit “unassigned” reason

SIM drift: scenario outputs must be dated and tied to assumptions

12. Definition of Done (Decision System v0)

Firmament decision support is “done” when:

every sector drilldown generates a brief + ranked actions,

actions above thresholds route into GGE as decision packets,

approved actions instantiate CWP tasks,

Firmament can show decision status + execution progress,

and the decision trace can be audited end-to-end.

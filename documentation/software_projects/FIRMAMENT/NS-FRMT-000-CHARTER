NS-FIRMAMENT-000 — CHARTER

Project: Firmament (3D Operations Globe)
Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)
Governance Authority: GGE (Governance Graph Engine)
Status: Draft v0.1

⸻

1. Purpose

Firmament is a real-time, zoomable 3D visualization of Earth that projects Northfield Solidarity’s operations, entities, opportunities, risks, and planned moves as layered, filterable operational truth.

Its purpose is to transform “business complexity” into a spatial, actionable cockpit:
	•	See what’s happening now
	•	See what’s likely to happen next
	•	See what you should do about it
	•	Execute via governed actions (through GGE + CWP)

⸻

2. Mission Statement

Make operations and strategy legible at a glance by rendering the business as a living globe with on/off layers for:
	•	entities and logistics
	•	events and timelines
	•	sector health and heatmaps
	•	risks, blockers, and mitigations
	•	scenarios and “plan modes” (risk ↔ ambition)

⸻

3. Scope

In Scope

A) 3D Earth Visualization Core
	•	Earth globe rendering (zoomable, rotateable, focusable)
	•	Layer manager (toggle, filter, search)
	•	Pins / paths / regions (points, lines, polygons)

B) Entity + Logistics Mapping
	•	Map all business entities (NS, SL, subsidiaries, vendors, sites)
	•	Map logistics flows (supplier → 3PL → customer, etc.)
	•	Show relationship links + operational state

C) Events + Location Projection
	•	Upcoming events list linked to geo locations
	•	Event → drilldown: context, checklist, linked stakeholders, readiness state

D) Sector Heatmap Layer (Enhanced)
	•	A sector treemap/heatmap view (weight + performance)
	•	Selecting a sector reveals:
	•	what’s going well / failing
	•	root causes across ops/finance/supply/market
	•	actionable mitigation and growth steps
	•	plan slider variants (risk/ambition) that change recommended actions

E) Actionability
	•	Every insight must map to:
	•	a task (CWP) and/or
	•	a governed decision gate (GGE) and/or
	•	a simulation scenario (SIM)

Out of Scope (for initial releases)
	•	Full ERP replacement
	•	Full accounting system (FLO remains authoritative for ledgers)
	•	Autonomous execution without governance gates
	•	Real-time tracking that requires specialized hardware integrations unless explicitly added later

⸻

4. Key Users
	•	Owner/Operator (You): global situational awareness + rapid planning
	•	CWP Operators: tasking, accountability, readiness tracking
	•	Governance Reviewers (GGE): decision traceability, approvals, constraints
	•	Analysts (PIE/DRE/SIG consumers): signals → structured moves

⸻

5. Core Principles
	1.	Spatial truth beats dashboards: geography and flow make complexity comprehensible.
	2.	Layers, not screens: everything is a filterable overlay.
	3.	Click-to-cause, click-to-action: every visualization drills down to root cause and produces next steps.
	4.	Governed execution: no “important moves” without GGE traceability and gates.
	5.	Scenario-native: the risk/ambition slider is first-class, not an afterthought.
	6.	Render-ready projections: Firmament stores view models; engines remain sources of truth.

⸻

6. Primary Capabilities (MVP)
	1.	Globe + Layer System
	2.	Entity & Logistics Layer
	3.	Events Layer (list + map sync)
	4.	Sector Heatmap + Sector Operating Brief
	5.	Action Items + Owners + Status
	6.	Plan Slider (Conservative ↔ Aggressive) feeding scenario outputs

⸻

7. Integrations (Authoritative Sources)
	•	IDN: entity graph, identities, relationships
	•	MUX: external system integrations + data ingress
	•	SIG: alerts/signals that trigger overlays
	•	FLO: financial overlays (budget, cost, margin, exposure)
	•	SIM: scenario engine powering slider outcomes
	•	CWP: ownership, tasks, operational accountability
	•	GGE: governance gates, approvals, audit trail of decisions

⸻

8. Success Metrics
	•	Time-to-understand a situation (minutes → seconds)
	•	Time-to-action from signal to assigned mitigations
	•	Decision trace completeness (every major move has a GGE path)
	•	Operational coverage (% of entities/events/flows mapped)
	•	Scenario usefulness (slider outputs consistently change actions in meaningful ways)

⸻

9. Risks & Constraints
	•	Data completeness risk: visualization quality depends on structured ingestion.
	•	Over-complexity risk: must enforce “layer discipline” and avoid clutter.
	•	Latency risk: real-time features must degrade gracefully.
	•	Governance drift risk: Firmament must not become an ungated execution channel.

11. Definition of Done (v0)

Firmament v0 is “done” when:
	•	you can open the globe and toggle layers,
	•	see mapped entities + logistics + events,
	•	click a sector heatmap tile to get an operating brief + action list,
	•	adjust the risk/ambition slider and see the recommended actions change,
	•	and key actions route into CWP ownership and GGE governance.

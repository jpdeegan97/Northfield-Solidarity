## NS-FORK-000-CHARTER — Project FORK

**Codename / Working Name:** FORK (formerly “CUISINE”)
**One-liner:** A cuisine-themed meal planning + grocery sourcing system that can optionally book a nearby private cook/chef to prepare the meals for you.

---

### 1) Mission

Make it effortless to go from **“I want to eat *this way* for the next N days”** to:

* a coherent meal plan,
* ingredients you can actually buy *nearby* (with real options + substitutions),
* and an optional “someone will cook it for me” service layer.

---

### 2) Problem Statement

Cooking fails not because recipes don’t exist, but because the *workflow* is fragmented:

* inspiration ≠ planning
* planning ≠ pantry reality
* ingredients ≠ local availability or pricing
* shopping list ≠ store-optimized carts
* cooking intent ≠ time/skill constraints
* “I’d pay someone” ≠ trusted, convenient marketplace access

---

### 3) Core Outcomes

**For users**

* Multi-day cuisine/theme plans tailored to constraints (diet, allergies, time, budget, servings)
* Ingredient-level sourcing from nearby stores with options and substitutions
* Consolidated shopping list and estimated totals
* Optional private cook/chef booking for meal execution

**For the ecosystem**

* Neighborhood/building-level demand aggregation
* A repeatable “micro-chef marketplace” model with trust and safety as first-class constraints

---

### 4) Scope

#### In-scope (MVP → V1)

1. **Theme-driven planning**

   * Inputs: cuisine/theme, days, meals/day, time-per-meal, difficulty, budget, servings, dietary constraints, dislikes, equipment
   * Outputs: day-by-day meal suggestions + variety/leftover logic

2. **Local ingredient sourcing**

   * Determine “closest stores” via geo + preference weighting (price vs distance vs reliability)
   * Provide options per ingredient (brand/size/price) + substitutions
   * Produce store-optimized baskets (min trips, max availability, lowest cost)

3. **Optional Private Chef / Building Cook**

   * Post a cook request from a plan (schedule, menu, kitchen notes)
   * Verified cooks accept jobs (fee, time estimate, procurement model)
   * Ratings + repeat booking loop

#### Out-of-scope (initially)

* Medical nutrition prescription/coaching
* Global coverage across all grocers and regions
* Pantry computer vision scanning as a required capability
* Full restaurant delivery aggregation

---

### 5) Users & Personas

* **Busy Professional (Primary):** wants “decide for me,” minimal prep, predictable spend
* **Food Explorer:** wants authenticity, rotation, ingredient flexibility
* **Constraint-Driven Eater:** allergies/dietary filters must be strict
* **Micro-Chef / Building Cook:** flexible paid gigs nearby
* **Property/Community Partner (Later):** amenity offering; prioritizes safety and trust

---

### 6) Product Principles

* **Coherent weekly narrative:** meals feel connected, not random
* **Reality-first execution:** availability + substitutions > perfect recipe fantasy
* **Minimize friction:** plan → list → store options → cook mode
* **Trust & safety over growth** for any in-home services

---

### 7) Key Capabilities

#### A) Planning Engine

* “Theme Packs” (Thai Week, Mediterranean Light, High-Protein Fast, etc.)
* Constraint-aware generation with repeat/variety rules
* Difficulty slider and equipment awareness
* Leftover chaining (“cook once, reuse twice”)

#### B) Sourcing Engine

* Ingredient normalization (units, synonyms, canonical naming)
* Store matching (geo radius + chain support + item coverage)
* Substitution graph (“acceptable alternatives”)
* Basket optimization (single-store vs multi-store split)

#### C) Chef Marketplace Module

* Cook profiles: specialties, availability, radius, verification
* Booking: schedule, fee, cancellation policy, messaging
* Procurement model: user buys vs cook buys (later)
* Feedback loop and repeat hiring

---

### 8) Core Data Objects

* **UserProfile:** geo, constraints, preferences, budget, time windows
* **ThemePlan:** theme + constraints + generated itinerary
* **RecipeCard:** ingredients, steps, time, difficulty, variants
* **IngredientGraph:** canonical ingredient + aliases + substitutes + unit map
* **StoreCatalog:** store + items + price + availability + size
* **BasketPlan:** per-store item mapping + totals + alternatives
* **ChefProfile:** verification, radius, schedule, rate, specialties
* **Booking:** plan/menu, time, fee, policies, messages, rating

---

### 9) Trust, Safety, and Compliance (Chef Feature)

Non-negotiables for in-home cooking:

* **Identity verification** and optional **background checks** (jurisdiction-dependent)
* Clear role definition and **classification strategy** (contractor vs employee implications)
* Food safety expectations (allergen handling, sanitation checklist)
* Liability and insurance pathway (platform + provider considerations)
* Building access rules (no bypassing security/concierge)
* Incident reporting + dispute resolution workflow

---

### 10) Delivery Plan

**MVP-1 — Planning**

* Theme selection + N-day plan + shopping list export (no live store integration)

**MVP-2 — Sourcing**

* Integrate 1–2 grocers initially
* Options per ingredient + substitutions + basket totals

**V1 — Chef Beta**

* Pilot in 1–2 dense cities + building communities
* Invite-only cooks, strict verification, constrained booking windows

---

### 11) Success Metrics

* Plan acceptance rate (% plans kept vs regenerated)
* Meals cooked rate (completion)
* Ingredient fulfillment rate (items found without manual fixes)
* Time-to-cart (plan → ready-to-shop)
* Weekly retention / repeat planning
* Chef module: booking completion rate, incident rate, repeat bookings

---

### 12) Major Risks

* Store data mismatch (availability/pricing)
* Bad substitution logic harming experience
* In-home marketplace safety/liability complexity
* Unit economics (integration/support costs)
* Trust bootstrapping (supply + demand)

---

### 13) Naming Notes

**FORK** works well as a codename and brand seed:

* Implies branching choices (recipes, substitutions, store options)
* Simple, memorable, extensible (FORK Plan / FORK Cart / FORK Cook)

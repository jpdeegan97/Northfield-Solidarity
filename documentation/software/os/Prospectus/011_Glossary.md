# 011 — Glossary

- **TSU**: Thermodynamic Sampling Unit — probabilistic hardware designed to efficiently sample from distributions / energy models.
- **PRS**: Probabilistic Runtime Service — the single API surface engines call.
- **EProgram**: Energy/Factor Program — the portable specification of the distribution to sample.
- **SState**: Stochastic State — typed container of random variables and constraints.
- **HCG / Heterogeneous Compute Graph**: execution graph mixing deterministic nodes and sampling nodes.
- **QoS**: Quality of Service; latency/energy/accuracy targets.
- **Provenance Capsule**: structured record describing what ran, where, with what settings, and why.

Notes:
- Naming is flexible; the important thing is the contract surfaces and invariants.

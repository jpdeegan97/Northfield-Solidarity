# Runbooks (Core 5)

1. Credential leak / token compromise  
2. Suspicious login / account takeover  
3. Container/workload compromise  
4. Data exposure event  
5. Supply chain compromise  

Each runbook should include: trigger, containment steps, evidence capture, rotation steps, recovery, and prevention follow-ups.

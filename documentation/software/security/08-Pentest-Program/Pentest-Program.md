# Penetration Testing Program

## Rules
- Only test what you own or have explicit authorization to test.
- Always define scope and stop conditions.

## Cadence
- Automated scans: continuous / nightly
- Manual threat-led testing: quarterly or per major release

## Coverage
- Auth flows and session handling
- Engine-to-engine authZ bypass attempts
- K8s RBAC and namespace isolation
- Supply chain simulation (CI token misuse)
- Data exfil paths (SSRF, egress channels)

## Outputs
- Findings with severity, exploitability, blast radius
- Fix plan + owner
- Retest report

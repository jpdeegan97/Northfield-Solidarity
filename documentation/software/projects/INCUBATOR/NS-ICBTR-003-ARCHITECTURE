NS-INC-003 — ARCHITECTURE

NS-INC (Incubator) is an iteration-control architecture built around a simple idea:

Artifacts are the system.

Incubator produces and routes a small set of structured artifacts that preserve continuity and drive consistent iteration across Northfield Solidarity projects.

1) High-level architecture (conceptual)

Incubator has six layers:

Capture Layer — where artifacts are created (you + ChatGPT, optionally tooling)

Canonical Artifact Layer — structured docs (daily/weekly/monthly)

Archive Layer — file system source of truth (versioned optional)

Index Layer — derived indexes/rollups for search and metrics

Routing Layer — mapping artifacts into engines

Consumer Engines — quickscope, GGE, DRE, LUM (and future consumers)

2) Core components

2.1 Capture Layer

Primary interface (v1): manual + ChatGPT prompts.

Capture modes:

Daily: MorningBrief + EveningDebrief (via NS-CHRONICLE)

Weekly: WeeklyPlan + WeeklyRetro + CarryoverAgingReport

Monthly: DirectionReview + DecisionDigest

Design constraints:

Must work with copy/paste.

Must not require integrations to be useful.

2.2 Canonical Artifact Layer

Incubator defines a minimum artifact set (the “Iteration Spine”).

Daily artifacts (operator continuity)

MorningBrief (AM)

EveningDebrief (PM)

Weekly artifacts (iteration control)

WeeklyPlan

WeeklyRetro

CarryoverAgingReport

Monthly artifacts (direction control)

DirectionReview

DecisionDigest

Incubator consumes daily continuity from NS-CHRONICLE and upgrades it into weekly/monthly control.

2.3 Archive Layer (Source of Truth)

The archive is the source of truth. Indexes and ingestion outputs are derived.

Recommended layout:

NS-INC/

daily/ (links or copies of Chronicle artifacts)

weekly/

monthly/

indexes/

rollups/

Typical structure:

NS-INC/daily/YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.am.xml

NS-INC/daily/YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.pm.xml

NS-INC/weekly/YYYY/YYYY-WW.weeklyplan.xml

NS-INC/weekly/YYYY/YYYY-WW.weeklyretro.xml

NS-INC/weekly/YYYY/YYYY-WW.carryoveraging.json

NS-INC/monthly/YYYY/YYYY-MM.directionreview.xml

NS-INC/monthly/YYYY/YYYY-MM.decisiondigest.xml

Version control:

Optional but recommended (git) for diffs and provenance.

2.4 Index Layer (Derived)

Incubator creates derived views for:

fast search (project/decision/carryover)

time allocation (by project/type)

carryover aging/closure

decision velocity

Index artifacts (examples):

daily index.json

weekly rollup (md + json)

monthly rollup (md + json)

This layer can start as simple scripts and later become an engine job.

2.5 Routing Layer (Artifact → Engine mapping)

Incubator is the coordinator; engines are consumers.

Routing rules:

Carryovers route to quickscope as actionable state transitions

Decisions + standards route to GGE as governance nodes

Research sessions + learnings route to DRE as knowledge nodes

Ops work + incidents route to LUM as operational events

Incubator enforces that every routed object has:

a project tag

a type

evidence links when possible

2.6 Consumer Engines

quickscope (Intervention)

Inputs: carryovers, next actions, priorities

Outputs: state transitions, aging, closure metrics

GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Inputs: decisions, standards, policy changes

Outputs: governance graph of “what changed and why”

DRE (Deep Research Engine)

Inputs: research work blocks, learnings, sources

Outputs: connected knowledge graph and trend mapping

LUM

Inputs: incidents, degradations, ops work blocks

Outputs: dashboards, alerts, incident timelines

3) Data flow (daily → weekly → monthly)

3.1 Daily flow

MorningBrief sets intent + top priorities.

Work happens.

EveningDebrief captures shipped artifacts, decisions, learnings, carryovers.

Carryovers are routed (optional v1) or staged for weekly planning.

3.2 Weekly flow

WeeklyPlan selects 1–3 outcomes across projects.

Week execution is guided by daily capture.

WeeklyRetro reconciles plan vs reality.

CarryoverAgingReport forces closure decisions (do/decide/drop).

3.3 Monthly flow

DirectionReview summarizes movement and drift.

DecisionDigest records major decisions and how they changed trajectory.

Month-level intent is set for next cycle.

4) Adoption tiers (how to implement without overbuilding)

Tier A — Manual (start here)

You generate artifacts in chat.

You store them in the archive.

You rely on human recall + basic grep.

Tier B — Indexed

Scripts generate daily indexes and weekly/monthly rollups.

You can query “what happened” quickly.

Tier C — Engine-routed

Parsed objects emit events into quickscope/GGE/DRE/LUM.

You get dashboards and cross-project state visibility.

5) Non-functional requirements

Low friction: artifacts must be fast to create.

Deterministic: stable schemas and versioning.

Provenance: raw artifacts preserved; derived views rebuildable.

Privacy: no secrets; links over sensitive content.

Resilience: the system works even if engines are offline.

6) Architecture guardrails

Archive remains source of truth.

Unknown fields are ignorable (forward compatible).

Carryovers must always have a next action.

Decisions must have rationale.

Evidence links are expected for anything “shipped.”

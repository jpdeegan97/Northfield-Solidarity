NS-INC-004 — LIFECYCLE

This document defines the Incubator lifecycle: the repeatable daily/weekly/monthly iteration cycle Incubator enforces across Northfield Solidarity.

Incubator’s lifecycle is an operating rhythm plus a set of artifacts. The artifacts are the checkpoints that prevent drift.

1) Lifecycle goals

Keep momentum continuous (no “context reboot” each day).

Convert effort into outcomes (artifacts, decisions, learnings).

Make open loops explicit (carryovers with next actions).

Provide a predictable cadence for planning and review.

2) The three nested cycles

Incubator runs three nested cycles:

Daily Cycle — continuity + execution

Weekly Cycle — iteration plan + retro + carryover control

Monthly Cycle — direction control + governance digest

The weekly cycle aggregates daily reality. The monthly cycle aggregates weekly movement.

3) Daily Cycle (D1)

Artifacts: MorningBrief (AM) + EveningDebrief (PM) (via NS-CHRONICLE)

3.1 Inputs

Yesterday’s carryovers

Current constraints (meetings, energy, deadlines)

Any active weekly outcomes

3.2 Steps

AM Load (MorningBrief)

Declare today’s intent

Select Top 1–3 priorities

Define what “done” means for each

Set at least one focus rule

Execute (WorkBlocks)

Do work in blocks; attach project tags and links when possible

PM Save State (EveningDebrief)

Summarize day from first-person perspective

Record what shipped (artifacts)

Record decisions + learnings

Convert open loops → carryovers with next actions

Seed tomorrow’s candidates

3.3 Daily “Definition of Done”

Daily cycle is complete when:

PM debrief exists

At least one WorkBlock is recorded

Carryovers are explicit (or explicitly none)

3.4 Daily exit criteria (stop the bleeding)

If you are overloaded or the day is chaotic:

produce a minimal PM debrief with:

what happened

top 3 carryovers

tomorrow seed

4) Weekly Cycle (W1)

Artifacts: WeeklyPlan + WeeklyRetro + CarryoverAgingReport

4.1 Weekly cadence

WeeklyPlan: start of week (or the first working day)

WeeklyRetro: end of week (or last working day)

CarryoverAgingReport: produced during retro (or immediately after)

4.2 WeeklyPlan structure

Inputs:

last week’s retro

carryover backlog and aging

monthly direction constraints

Steps:

Select 1–3 Weekly Outcomes (max)

Choose a small backlog of secondary goals

Identify risks and mitigations

Decide any “must decide” items this week

Definition of Done:

1–3 outcomes with clear evidence targets

risk list and constraints recorded

4.3 Weekly execution rule

Daily priorities should usually map to one of:

a weekly outcome

a necessary carryover

a deliberate exception (incident, urgent ops)

4.4 WeeklyRetro structure

Steps:

Compare planned outcomes vs shipped reality

Identify top wins and misses

Capture lessons that change next week’s behavior

Update standards/decisions if needed

Definition of Done:

wins and misses recorded

at least one behavior change or adjustment noted

4.5 CarryoverAgingReport (the enforcement tool)

Purpose: prevent open-loop buildup.

Rules:

Every carryover older than a threshold must be:

progressed,

converted into a decision,

delegated,

or explicitly dropped.

Aging bands (recommended):

0–2 days: normal

3–7 days: review required

8–21 days: intervention required

>21 days: must decide (do/kill/park)

5) Monthly Cycle (M1)

Artifacts: DirectionReview + DecisionDigest

5.1 Monthly cadence

Run at month end or the first day of the next month.

5.2 DirectionReview

Steps:

Summarize what moved (by project)

Summarize what stalled and why

Identify drift (work done not aligned to outcomes)

Set next month’s intent and focus constraints

Definition of Done:

clear narrative + 3–5 directional focus statements

5.3 DecisionDigest

Steps:

Collect major decisions from the month

Record rationale and consequences

Link decisions to artifacts shipped

Definition of Done:

all high-impact decisions are captured and searchable

6) Gates and guardrails

6.1 Outcome gate

An outcome is only “done” if it has evidence (doc ID, PR, runbook, etc.).

6.2 Decision gate

A decision is only “made” if rationale is recorded.

6.3 Carryover gate

Every carryover must have a next action.

6.4 Drift gate

If more than half of the week’s time goes to unplanned work, WeeklyPlan must be adjusted and logged.

7) Lifecycle failure modes (and fixes)

Too many priorities: cap outcomes and enforce Top 3.

Carryover pile-up: run aging report and kill/park items.

No shipping: tighten outcome definitions into artifacts.

Planning theatre: shorten plans; prioritize execution and PM debrief.

NS-INC-000 — CHARTER (Incubator Iteration Control)

1) Mission

Create a single Northfield Solidarity project (“Incubator”) that controls iteration cycles across projects/engines so momentum is continuous, priorities are explicit, and progress compounds without context loss.

Incubator is the operating system for:

planning → execution → review → learning → next iteration

2) Problem statement

As NS grows (multiple engines, standards, infra, legal, product), work fragments:

priorities drift

decisions get lost

context resets after sleep/interruptions

iteration cadence becomes inconsistent

Incubator exists to standardize iteration loops (daily/weekly/monthly) and ensure every project has:

a current plan

measurable outcomes

a decision log

a next action queue

3) Scope

In scope

A unified iteration cadence:

Daily continuity (AM/PM state capture)

Weekly iteration plan + retro

Monthly direction review

Standard artifacts and “minimum viable governance” for all NS projects

A routing layer that pushes artifacts into:

quickscope (state / carryovers)

GGE (decisions / policies)

DRE (research threads / learnings)

LUM (ops events / incidents)

Out of scope (initially)

Replacing your task manager/calendar

Heavy workflow tooling (start lightweight, automate later)

4) Primary users

You (primary operator)

Future NS operators/engine leads (secondary)

5) Core principles

One loop to rule them all: every project follows the same iteration rhythm.

Outcome over activity: measure what shipped/decided/learned.

Continuity is a feature: state is saved daily.

Explicit carryovers: open loops are named, prioritized, and aged.

Evidence-first: link to docs/PRs/tickets/runbooks.

6) Interfaces (how Incubator connects)

NS-CHRONICLE: daily AM/PM continuity feed (personal operator layer)

quickscope (Intervention): carryovers become state transitions / next actions

GGE: decisions and standards become governance nodes

DRE: research learnings become knowledge graph nodes

LUM: ops work + incidents become operational events

7) Deliverables

Incubator defines and enforces the following artifact set:

7.1 Daily (operator)

MorningBrief + EveningDebrief (first-person)

7.2 Weekly (iteration)

WeeklyPlan (Top 3 outcomes + backlog)

WeeklyRetro (wins, misses, lessons, adjustments)

CarryoverAgingReport (what’s stuck and why)

7.3 Monthly (direction)

DirectionReview (what moved, what didn’t, what changes next month)

DecisionDigest (major decisions and rationale)

8) Operating cadence

Daily: continuity capture + carryover routing

Weekly: plan (start of week) + retro (end of week)

Monthly: direction and governance review

9) Success metrics

Morning “time-to-context” ≤ 5 minutes

Weekly shipped artifacts increase

Carryover aging decreases (fewer stale open loops)

Decision recall improves (decisions are findable and linked)

10) Risks and mitigations

Overhead creep: keep artifacts minimal; automate only after behavior sticks

Too rigid: allow exceptions, but require explicit rationale

Tool sprawl: archive-first, tool-agnostic; engines are optional consumers

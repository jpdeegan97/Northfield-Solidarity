NS-INC-002 — TAXONOMY

This document defines the vocabulary and canonical “objects” used by NS-INC (Incubator) to control iteration cycles across Northfield Solidarity.

The goal is consistent language so planning, execution, review, and routing can be automated later without changing how you work today.

1) Core taxonomy objects

Incubator standardizes nine primary object types:

Cycle — a named iteration window (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)

Intent — the directional theme for a cycle

Outcome — a measurable end state for a cycle

Artifact — a durable output (doc/code/runbook/etc.)

WorkBlock — a unit of effort tied to a project and outcome

Decision — a committed choice with rationale

Learning — durable insight that changes future behavior

Risk — a predicted threat with mitigation

Carryover — an open loop with a next action

2) Cycle taxonomy

2.1 Cycle types

DailyCycle: continuity (AM/PM) and execution focus

WeeklyCycle: iteration plan + retro + carryover management

MonthlyCycle: direction review + governance/strategy alignment

2.2 Cycle properties

All cycles have:

CycleId (recommended):

Daily: YYYY-MM-DD

Weekly: YYYY-WW

Monthly: YYYY-MM

StartDate, EndDate

Intent

Outcomes[]

Constraints[] (optional)

3) Project taxonomy (routing key)

3.1 Project tag rule

Every WorkBlock, Artifact, Decision, and Carryover should include a project tag.

Canonical project tags (examples; extend as needed):

NS-INC (Incubator)

NS-CHRONICLE (daily continuity layer)

NS-PG, NS-LUM, NS-AEGIS, NS-DRE, NS-CWP, NS-CICD

NS-BCO, NS-OCP, NS-OS, NS-FRMT

NS-LEGAL, NS-FIN, NS-ADMIN

3.2 Subproject / artifact ID

When available, include:

DocId (e.g., NS-PG-006)

ArtifactId (PR/commit/ticket/runbook)

4) Outcome taxonomy

4.1 Outcome types

ship — a new/updated artifact exists

stabilize — reliability/latency/operational stability improved

decide — a decision is recorded and linked

learn — a learning is captured and applied

de-risk — a known risk reduced (backup verified, drill completed, etc.)

4.2 Outcome definition rule

Every Outcome must include:

OutcomeDefinition (what “done” means)

Evidence (link/doc ID) when possible

4.3 Outcome status

planned

in_progress

shipped

blocked

dropped

5) Artifact taxonomy

5.1 Artifact types

doc

code

infra

ops

runbook

decision

research

design

5.2 Artifact impact scale

tiny — minor improvement

small — noticeable improvement

medium — meaningful milestone

large — major milestone

critical — foundational/existential

5.3 Evidence links

Supported evidence link prefixes:

doc: internal doc ID

repo: repository path

pr: pull request

issue: ticket

runbook: runbook ID

url: external reference

6) Work taxonomy

6.1 WorkBlock

A WorkBlock is a unit of effort with optional time tracking.

Required fields:

Project

WhatIDid

Recommended fields:

Type (see below)

Result

TimeSpentMinutes

Links[]

6.2 Work types

doc|code|infra|ops|research|design|decision|meeting|admin

6.3 Work modes (optional)

deepwork|shallowwork|reactive|creative

7) Decision taxonomy

7.1 Decision classes

naming

architecture

security

operations

product

people

finance

legal

7.2 Decision status

draft

made

reversed

7.3 Decision fields (minimum)

Title

Choice

Rationale

Project (recommended)

Link (recommended)

8) Learning taxonomy

8.1 Learning fields

WhatILearned

HowItChangesNextIteration

Project (optional)

Link (optional)

Learning intent:

convert insight into a rule, habit, or standard.

9) Risk taxonomy

9.1 Risk classes

schedule

technical

security

continuity

scope

people

vendor

9.2 Risk severity

low|medium|high

9.3 Risk fields

Description

Severity

Mitigation

Owner (optional)

Evidence (optional)

10) Carryover taxonomy

Carryovers are the “open loops” Incubator controls.

10.1 Priority

high|medium|low

10.2 Carryover types

execution — needs doing

decision — needs choosing

research — needs investigation

waiting — blocked externally

bug — defect to fix

risk — looming hazard to mitigate

10.3 Blocker types (optional)

time|dependency|clarity|energy|access|tooling

10.4 Carryover fields (minimum)

Title

NextAction

Priority

Type (carryover type)

Project (recommended)

11) Scoring taxonomy (optional but useful)

Incubator may track subjective scores per cycle:

OutcomeScore (0–10)

FocusScore (0–10)

EnergyScore (0–10)

Use these to detect drift/burnout patterns.

12) Routing taxonomy (where objects flow)

Carryovers → quickscope

Decisions + standards → GGE

Research threads + learnings → DRE

Ops work + incidents → LUM

Incubator is the coordinator; engines are the consumers.

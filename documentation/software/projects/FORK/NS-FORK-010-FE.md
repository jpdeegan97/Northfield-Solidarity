# NS-FORK-010-FE — Frontend / UX

## Core Screens
1. **Intent Builder**
   - Duration, meals/day, healthiness slider
   - Dietary constraints, allergies, dislikes
   - Budget + time constraints
2. **Menu Review**
   - Day-by-day calendar, swap meals, regenerate day
   - “Why this meal” explainability
3. **Ingredient Ledger**
   - Pantry deductions, unit conversions
   - Substitution preferences
4. **Cart Options**
   - Tabs: Cheapest / Fastest / Balanced / Fewest Stores / Best Quality
   - “Refresh pricing” button and staleness warnings
5. **Checkout Orchestration**
   - Partner checkout, store deep links, or in-app where allowed
6. **Chef (Optional)**
   - Browse chefs, filters, certifications badges
   - Booking details + kitchen checklist + policies
7. **Feedback**
   - Rate meals, mark substitutions, save favorites, “never show again”

## UX Principles
- Make tradeoffs explicit and legible.
- Keep allergy/diet safety obvious and interruptive when needed.
- Reduce cognitive load: default plan + easy edits.

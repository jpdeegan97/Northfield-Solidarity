# NS-FORK-001-OVERVIEW — Overview

## What FORK does (end-to-end)
1. **User Intent Capture**  
   User specifies: cuisine/theme, duration, meals/day, healthiness slider, diet rules, allergies, budget, time constraints, cooking skill, equipment, and preferences.
2. **Curated Menu Generation**  
   FORK creates a day-by-day menu with recipes, prep time, nutrition estimates, leftovers strategy, and substitutions.
3. **Procurement Optimization**  
   FORK searches nearby stores and returns optimized cart options:
   - Cheapest total cost
   - Fastest delivery/pickup
   - Fewest stores
   - Best quality (brand/organic preferences)
   - Balanced (weighted objective)
4. **Optional Chef Fulfillment**  
   In supported markets: book a vetted chef to cook the plan (single session or recurring), with sanitation and verification baked in.

## Primary Outputs
- **Menu Plan** (calendar)
- **Recipe Cards** (steps, time, nutrition, allergens)
- **Ingredient Ledger** (normalized items + quantities)
- **Cart Options** (store strategy variants)

- **Transparent substitutions** (user confirms)
- **Auditability** (what changed and why)

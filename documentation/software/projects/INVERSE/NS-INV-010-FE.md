# NS-INV-010-FE — Frontend / UX

## Core Screens
- **Conversation Timeline**: turns, episodes, key spans
- **Latent Explorer**: candidates grouped by class + confidence
- **Evidence Viewer**: highlight spans supporting each candidate
- **Diff / Drift**: compare two runs or versions
- **Audit & Gate Report**: why exports were blocked/allowed

## UX Principles
- Always show: **evidence, uncertainty, provenance**.
- Separate explicit vs inferred vs speculative.
- One-click export into GGE/DRE/CWP with gate preview.

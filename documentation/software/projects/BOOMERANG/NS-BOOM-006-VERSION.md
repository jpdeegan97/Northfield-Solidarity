# NS-BOOM-006-VERSION — Versioning & Reproducibility

## Versioned Objects
- RunSpec versions (edits tracked)
- Asset bundles (landing page/copy/scripts)
- Targeting definitions (audiences, keywords, lists)
- Iteration logs (what changed, when)
- Report version (final vs revised)

## Reproducibility Rules
- Every run has a unique ID and a pinned snapshot of:
  - assets used
  - audiences/lists
  - budget/spend caps
  - timebox start/stop
- Reports must reference those snapshots.

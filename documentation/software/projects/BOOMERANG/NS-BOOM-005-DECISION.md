# NS-BOOM-005-DECISION — Decisions & Defaults

## Defaults
- Every run has:
  - RunSpec (mandatory)
  - Instrumentation checklist complete before launch
  - Postmortem within 24h of close
- Run timeboxes:
  - standard: 72h / 7d / 14d
- Mandatory reporting:
  - what changed during iteration and why
  - what would be done differently next time

## Decision Gates (examples)
- **Double down** if:
  - qualified lead rate ≥ threshold AND CAC proxy within bound
- **Pivot** if:
  - engagement high but objections cluster around positioning/pricing
- **Park** if:
  - signals exist but channel economics are poor; revisit with different channel
- **Kill** if:
  - no meaningful signal after timebox and iterations

## Anti-Patterns
- Changing too many variables at once
- Running without telemetry (no “feel-only” runs)
- Letting runs drift past timebox
- Optimizing vanity metrics without intent signals

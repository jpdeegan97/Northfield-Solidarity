# NS-BOOM-000-CHARTER — Project Charter (Boomerang)

**Project Name:** Boomerang  
**Acronym:** BOOM  
**Type:** Prototyping Project (Market Probe / Strategy Attack)  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Owner:** Northfield Solidarity — Incubator / GTM Lab  
**Status:** Draft / Working Spec

---

## 0. Summary
Boomerang (BOOM) is a standardized “toe-dip” prototyping project for executing **micro-attacks** into markets using defined approach strategies, monitoring execution agentically, and generating structured post-run reporting. The core output is a growing dataset of **Market × Strategy** outcomes so future product bets can be informed by real-world behavior, not theory.

## 1. Mission
Run fast, controlled market probes and bring back truth—**what worked, what didn’t, and why**—with repeatable methods and comparable metrics.

## 2. Objectives
- Launch small, time-boxed probes with minimal asset requirements.
- Execute continuously with agentic monitoring and iterative tuning.
- Collect standardized telemetry (quant + qual) across runs.
- Produce comparable reports and a “strategy effectiveness” library.
- Enable rapid decisions: double-down, pivot, park, or kill.

## 3. Non-Goals
- Building full production products.
- Long, unfocused marketing campaigns.
- “Growth hacking” that violates policies, platform terms, or brand rules.
- Replacing DRE/LUM/GGE; Boomerang integrates with them for research, observability, and governance.

## 4. Primary Users
- You (operator) to validate markets and offers quickly.
- GTM builders running repeated experiments.
- Strategy/research roles synthesizing learnings across runs.

## 5. Success Criteria
- Time-to-first-signal is low (hours/days, not weeks).
- Run artifacts are reusable (copy blocks, landing pages, scripts).
- Reports are comparable and decision-oriented.
- The Market × Strategy library compounds into clear guidance.

## 6. Risks
- Confounding variables across runs (non-comparable experiments).
- Bias toward noisy channels and vanity metrics.
- Under-instrumentation (can’t explain outcomes).
- Policy/brand compliance issues in outreach and data collection.

## 7. Guardrails
- Every run has a **RunSpec** with constraints + success criteria.
- Mandatory instrumentation checklist before going live.
- Ethics/brand policies enforced; no deceptive or abusive tactics.
- Postmortem required; no “silent runs.”

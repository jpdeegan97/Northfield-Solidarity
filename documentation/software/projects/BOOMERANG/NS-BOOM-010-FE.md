# NS-BOOM-010-FE — UX / Product Surfaces

## Screens
1. **Run Builder**
   - market slice picker
   - strategy template selection
   - offer definition
   - success criteria + timebox + budget caps
2. **Launch Console**
   - start/stop, spend tracker, “time remaining”
3. **Iteration Log**
   - timeline of changes with diff + rationale
4. **Telemetry Dashboard**
   - funnel, spend, lead quality, qualitative tags
5. **Postmortem Builder**
   - guided report creation
6. **Library**
   - strategy templates
   - market slices
   - outcomes explorer (Market × Strategy heatmaps later)

## UX Principles
- Run comparability is sacred.
- Make tradeoffs explicit; reduce “vibes-only” decisions.
- Reports are decision tools, not narratives.

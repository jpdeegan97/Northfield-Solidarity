# NS-BOOM-001-OVERVIEW — Overview

## What a “Boomerang Run” is
A **Boomerang Run** is a time-boxed market probe defined by:
- Market definition (ICP, geo, channel, price band)
- Strategy template (approach)
- Offer (what is being sold or validated)
- Budget/timebox constraints
- Telemetry schema (what gets measured)
- Decision gates (what outcomes trigger next steps)

## End-to-end Flow
1. Define RunSpec (market + strategy + offer + constraints)
2. Build minimal assets (landing, copy, scripts)
3. Launch & monitor (agentic iteration within bounds)
4. Collect telemetry (quant + qual)
5. Generate report (postmortem + scorecard)
6. Archive artifacts + update Strategy Library
7. Decide: double-down / pivot / park / kill

## Outputs
- Boomerang Report (structured)
- Strategy Scorecard (comparable)
- Artifact Bundle (assets + versions)
- Learning Library update (Market × Strategy)

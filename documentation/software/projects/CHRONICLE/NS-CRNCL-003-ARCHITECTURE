NS-CHRONICLE-003 — ARCHITECTURE

NS-CHRONICLE is a lightweight capture system with a clean data pipeline into your broader Northfield Solidarity ecosystem (GGE / DRE / quickscope). The design prioritizes:

extremely low friction capture (AM/PM)

deterministic structure (XML)

easy local storage + diffing

optional ingestion into graph/state systems

1) High-level system diagram (conceptual)

Capture UI (you + ChatGPT)

Canonical XML artifact (MorningBrief / EveningDebrief)

Local Archive (files organized by date)

Index + Search (optional)

Ingestion Pipeline (optional)

Downstream Engines (GGE / DRE / quickscope)

2) Core components

2.1 Capture Interface

Primary interface: ChatGPT prompt → XML output.

Capture modes:

AM Mode: plan + intent + top priorities + constraints

PM Mode: recap + shipped + decisions + learnings + carryovers

Design constraints:

must work with copy/paste

must not require external integrations to be useful

2.2 Canonical XML Artifacts

Two schemas:

MorningBrief

EveningDebrief

Rules:

first-person voice

stable field names (from NS-CHRONICLE-002)

links are evidence anchors

uncertainty is explicit (<Uncertain>true</Uncertain>)

2.3 Archive Layer (Source of Truth)

Source of truth is the file archive (not the chat).

Recommended directory layout:

NS-CHRONICLE/

YYYY/

YYYY-MM/

YYYY-MM-DD.am.xml

YYYY-MM-DD.pm.xml

YYYY-MM-DD.notes.md (optional freeform)

Why this layout:

stable chronological ordering

easy git versioning + diffs

easy ingestion batching

2.4 Index Layer (Optional)

If you want fast recall (search by project/topic/decision):

Two tiers:

Light index (recommended first):

daily generated JSON summary index (per day)

supports quick grep or simple search

Deep index (later):

embed key fields into DRE graph

cross-link decisions ↔ artifacts ↔ projects

2.5 Ingestion Pipeline (Optional, but designed-in)

CHRONICLE artifacts can be ingested into your engines as structured events.

Pipeline stages:

Parse XML

Normalize taxonomy fields (project IDs, types, impact)

Emit events

Write to graph/state stores

Event mapping (recommended):

WorkBlock → activity event

ShippedItem → artifact event

Decision → decision node + edges to projects

Learning → knowledge node

Carryover → open-loop task/state edge to next day

2.6 Downstream Consumers

GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

consumes: Decisions, policy changes, standards created

emits: governance context and “what changed” summaries

DRE (Deep Research Engine)

consumes: research threads, links, hypotheses, findings

emits: connected knowledge graph + trend mapping

quickscope (Intervention)

consumes: carryovers + next actions

emits: state transitions and next-day intent scaffolding

3) Data flow and lifecycle

3.1 Daily lifecycle

AM: create YYYY-MM-DD.am.xml

PM: create YYYY-MM-DD.pm.xml

(Optional) generate YYYY-MM-DD.index.json

(Optional) ingest into engines nightly

3.2 Weekly / monthly lifecycle (optional)

weekly rollup: top shipped items, major decisions, learnings, carryover closure

monthly map: where time went by project, what moved forward, what stalled

4) Architecture constraints and guardrails

4.1 Minimal friction

if capture takes too long, the system will die

keep fields short; use links for depth

4.2 Determinism

avoid free-text where a taxonomy enum exists

only expand where it creates durable value (decisions/learnings)

4.3 Privacy and security

do not paste secrets into Chronicle

if sensitive: store only references (ticket IDs, doc IDs)

5) “Continuity guarantees” (what this architecture ensures)

If you follow the loop:

tomorrow morning you can reconstruct:

what mattered yesterday

what shipped

what changed direction

what is still open and the next action

This is the core continuity guarantee.

6) Implementation tiers (how to adopt)

Tier 1 — Manual (start here)

ChatGPT produces XML

you save files in the archive layout

Tier 2 — Indexed

nightly script creates index.json per day

grep/search across projects/decisions/carryovers

Tier 3 — Engine-ingested

parser emits events into GGE/DRE/quickscope

graph shows:

time allocation by project

decision network over time

carryover aging and closure

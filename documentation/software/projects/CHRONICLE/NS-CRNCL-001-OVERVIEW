NS-CHRONICLE-001 — OVERVIEW

1) What NS-CHRONICLE is

NS-CHRONICLE is Northfield Solidarity’s personal continuity + productivity layer: a twice-daily ritual that produces structured, first-person records so you can resume instantly after sleep, interruptions, or context switching.

It’s designed for high-context building (engines, infra, legal, product) where momentum dies if state isn’t captured.

2) The two daily artifacts

NS-CHRONICLE produces exactly two artifacts per day:

MorningBrief (AM)

Captures: intent, top priorities, success definitions, constraints, risks, and carryovers.

Output: a plan that is small enough to execute.

EveningDebrief (PM)

Captures: what you actually did, what shipped, decisions made, lessons learned, failures, and carryovers.

Output: a state snapshot + a clean handoff to tomorrow.

Both are written in first-person and output as XML for storage, diffing, and ingestion.

3) The continuity loop (how it works)

EveningDebrief creates a structured set of carryovers + decision records.

MorningBrief consumes those carryovers and converts them into today’s plan.

The cycle repeats, keeping your work “loaded in RAM.”

The key property: every open loop is either:

converted into a carryover with a next action, or

explicitly dropped.

4) Why XML (the platform intent)

XML is chosen because it is:

easy to copy/paste

deterministic and parseable

friendly to diffs and versioning

ingestible by your internal systems (GGE / DRE / quickscope)

NS-CHRONICLE is intentionally format-stable so it can become a data stream.

5) Integration points inside Northfield Solidarity

NS-CHRONICLE is a meta-layer that can feed:

GGE: decisions, governance changes, policy evolution

DRE: research threads, findings, hypotheses to map into the graph

quickscope (Intervention): state snapshots and next-state intents

NS-LUM: incident summaries and ops learnings (high-level)

In practice:

every work block should include a Project tag (NS-PG, NS-BCO, NS-AEGIS, etc.)

every shipped artifact should include a link or doc ID when possible

6) The “From my perspective” requirement

NS-CHRONICLE must sound like you.

Rules:

Use “I did / I decided / I learned / I will…”

Prefer outcomes over effort

Name the next action on every carryover

7) Expected time cost

Morning: 3–10 minutes

Evening: 5–12 minutes

If it consistently takes longer, the template should be tightened.

8) What comes next

Next documents should formalize:

NS-CHRONICLE-002 — TAXONOMY (projects, work types, tags, scoring)

NS-CHRONICLE-003 — OPERATING ROUTINE (cadence, prompts, storage conventions)

NS-CHRONICLE-004 — DATA MODEL (XML schema constraints + ingestion mapping)

NS-CHRONICLE-004 — OPERATING ROUTINE

This document defines how you run NS-CHRONICLE every day with minimal friction, maximum continuity, and clean handoffs into the rest of Northfield Solidarity.

1) The daily cadence (non-negotiable)

NS-CHRONICLE is a two-touch system:

1.1 Morning (AM) — “Load the day”

Target time: within 30 minutes of starting work

Duration: 3–10 minutes

Artifact: MorningBrief XML

1.2 Evening (PM) — “Save state”

Target time: last work action of the day (before sleep)

Duration: 5–12 minutes

Artifact: EveningDebrief XML

If you only do one:

PM is more important than AM (because it preserves continuity).

2) The workflow (what you actually do)

2.1 AM workflow

Open yesterday’s pm.xml.

Copy forward carryovers you still care about.

Pick Top 3 priorities and write success definitions.

Declare at least one Focus Rule (what you won’t do today).

Save YYYY-MM-DD.am.xml.

2.2 PM workflow

Skim your AM brief (to compare plan vs reality).

List what you shipped (even if it’s “docs created”).

Capture decisions + learnings.

Convert every open loop into a carryover with NextAction.

Seed tomorrow’s top 3 candidates.

Save YYYY-MM-DD.pm.xml.

3) Storage conventions (Source of Truth)

The archive is the source of truth.

3.1 Directory layout (recommended)

NS-CHRONICLE/

YYYY/

YYYY-MM/

YYYY-MM-DD.am.xml

YYYY-MM-DD.pm.xml

YYYY-MM-DD.notes.md (optional)

3.2 File naming rules

AM file ends with .am.xml

PM file ends with .pm.xml

Date is ISO: YYYY-MM-DD

3.3 Version control (optional but powerful)

Git the archive for diffs and history.

Never store secrets (store references only).

4) Prompts (always produce the same XML)

Use these prompts verbatim so you always get compliant XML.

4.1 Morning prompt

Generate a MorningBrief in the NS-CHRONICLE XML format. Write in first-person (“I…”). Use my carryovers and current priorities from this chat. If info is missing, leave fields empty rather than inventing.

4.2 Evening prompt

Generate an EveningDebrief in the NS-CHRONICLE XML format. Write in first-person (“I…”). Summarize what I worked on today based on this chat, including what I shipped, decisions I made, and carryovers. If unsure, mark the field as <Uncertain>true</Uncertain> inside the relevant item.

5) Completion standards (what “done” means)

5.1 MorningBrief is complete if it has

OneSentenceIntent

1–3 TopPriorities with an OutcomeDefinition

At least one FocusRules/Rule

Any carryovers you still intend to advance

5.2 EveningDebrief is complete if it has

OneParagraphFromMyPerspective

At least one entry in WhatIWorkedOn (even if small)

At least one Carryover OR an explicit statement that nothing is carried

Tomorrow seed: at least 1 candidate

6) Timeboxing rules (to keep it effortless)

AM is not allowed to become planning theatre.

Limit to Top 3 priorities.

Everything else is secondary or carryover.

PM is not allowed to become a journal.

Capture outcomes, decisions, learnings, carryovers.

Put emotion or narrative in optional notes.

7) Continuity rules (the power rules)

Every carryover must include a NextAction.

Every decision must include a Rationale (one sentence is enough).

Every shipped artifact gets a link when possible (doc ID, repo path, PR).

If you’re unsure, mark it with <Uncertain>true</Uncertain>.

8) Integration routing (GGE / DRE / quickscope)

When you want to feed engines:

8.1 GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Send: Decisions, policy/standard updates, naming changes.

From Chronicle: <Decisions> and WhatIShipped items of type decision/doc.

8.2 DRE (Deep Research Engine)

Send: research threads, sources, hypotheses, conclusions.

From Chronicle: WorkBlocks of type research + <Learnings>.

8.3 quickscope (Intervention)

Send: carryovers + next actions as state transitions.

From Chronicle: <Continuity><Carryovers>.

8.4 LUM

Send: incident summaries, operational insights.

From Chronicle: WorkBlocks of type ops + any incident notes in Problems.

9) Weekly (optional) — “rollup” routine

Once per week (15–30 min):

Extract top shipped items

Extract major decisions

Review carryover aging (what is lingering?)

Pick next week’s theme/intent

(If you want, we can formalize this as NS-CHRONICLE-005.)

10) Failure modes and fixes

Too long: reduce fields; limit TopPriorities to 3; shorten narrative.

Too vague: strengthen OutcomeDefinition (“artifact exists at X”).

Carryover pile-up: enforce “drop or next action” rule; cap carryovers to 10.

No evidence: add doc IDs/links as you go; don’t rely on memory.

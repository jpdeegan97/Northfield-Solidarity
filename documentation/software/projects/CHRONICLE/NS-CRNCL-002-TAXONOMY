NS-CHRONICLE-002 — TAXONOMY

This document standardizes the vocabulary NS-CHRONICLE uses so your daily XML entries are consistent, searchable, and ingestible.

1) Entity taxonomy

NS-CHRONICLE entries describe five primary entity types:

WorkBlock — a unit of effort tied to a project and outcome

ShippedItem — an artifact that exists now (doc/code/decision/etc.)

Decision — a choice you made that changes trajectory

Learning — a durable insight that should persist

Carryover — an open loop explicitly handed to tomorrow

2) Project taxonomy

2.1 Project naming rule

Use a stable project identifier in every WorkBlock:

NS-PG (Postgres)

NS-BCO (Business Continuity Operations)

NS-AEGIS

NS-DRE

NS-LUM

NS-CWP

NS-CICD

NS-CHRONICLE

NS-OS (Fantasy Land)

NS-FRMT (Firmament)

NS-OCP (Onchain Compute Plane)

If work is “meta” (planning, hiring, finance, legal):

NS-ADMIN (admin/ops)

NS-LEGAL

NS-FIN

2.2 Subproject / doc IDs

When available, include:

DocId (e.g., NS-PG-006)

ArtifactId (PR, commit, ticket, runbook ref)

3) Work type taxonomy

Use these values for Type in ShippedItems and for WorkBlocks when you want to classify effort.

3.1 Allowed work types

doc — documentation/spec/standard

code — implementation

infra — infrastructure/platform work

ops — operations/on-call/incidents

research — investigation/reading/market scan

design — architecture/UI/UX

decision — governance or directional choice

meeting — meeting calls that materially advanced work

admin — business/admin tasks

3.2 Work mode (optional but useful)

deepwork

shallowwork

reactive

creative

4) Outcome taxonomy

4.1 Result quality (optional)

shipped — exists and is saved somewhere

progress — meaningful advancement but not done

blocked — could not proceed

abandoned — intentionally dropped

4.2 Impact scale (for ShippedItem.Impact)

tiny — minor improvement

small — noticeable improvement

medium — meaningful milestone

large — major milestone

critical — foundational or existential

5) Decision taxonomy

5.1 Decision classes

naming — naming/identity choices

architecture — system design/topology

security — access, controls, policy

operations — runbooks, on-call, SLOs

product — scope, roadmap, priorities

people — hiring, org, roles

finance — spend, pricing, budgets

legal — entity, contracts, compliance

5.2 Decision status

draft — thought formed but not committed

made — committed decision

reversed — explicitly changed later

6) Carryover taxonomy

Carryovers are the continuity backbone. Every carryover must have a NextAction.

6.1 Priority

high — blocks progress or time-sensitive

medium — important but not urgent

low — nice-to-have / background

6.2 Carryover type

execution — needs doing

decision — needs choosing

research — needs investigation

waiting — blocked on someone/something

bug — defect to fix

risk — looming hazard that needs mitigation

6.3 Blocker type (optional)

time

dependency

clarity

energy

access

tooling

7) Risk taxonomy (MorningBrief)

7.1 Risk class

schedule

technical

security

continuity

scope

people

vendor

7.2 Risk severity

low | medium | high

8) Scoring taxonomy (EveningDebrief)

Scores are intentionally simple and subjective.

Outcome (0–10): did the day produce meaningful outcomes?

Focus (0–10): did I stay on the right work?

Energy (0–10): how sustainable did it feel?

8.1 Optional score notes

Add short notes when the score is extreme (≤3 or ≥8) to capture why.

9) Link taxonomy (evidence)

Every major item should have at least one link when possible:

doc: internal doc ID (e.g., NS-PG-010)

repo: repository path

pr: pull request

issue: ticket

runbook: runbook ID

url: external reference

10) XML conventions (so parsing is easy)

10.1 Stable field rules

Keep field names stable (case-sensitive)

Prefer enumerations from this taxonomy

If unknown, leave empty rather than inventing

10.2 Uncertainty flag

If ChatGPT is unsure about a specific element, include:

<Uncertain>true</Uncertain>

inside the relevant node.

10.3 Time tracking

Time values are minutes (TimeSpentMinutes, TimeBoxMinutes)

Use best estimates; consistency matters more than precision

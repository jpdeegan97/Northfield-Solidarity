NS-CHRONICLE-007 — DATA MODEL (Conceptual + Engine Mapping)

This document defines the conceptual data model behind NS-CHRONICLE and the canonical mappings into Northfield Solidarity engines.

Note: NS-CHRONICLE-005 defines the XML schema + validation rules. This doc defines the entities, relationships, and event mapping (the “meaning” layer).

1) Core entities

NS-CHRONICLE centers on a small set of durable entities.

1.1 Day

Represents one calendar day of record.

Key fields:

date (YYYY-MM-DD)

timezone

author

Relationships:

Day has 0–1 MorningBrief

Day has 0–1 EveningDebrief

Day has many WorkBlocks, ShippedItems, Decisions, Learnings, Problems, Carryovers

1.2 MorningBrief

Represents planned intent + priorities for the day.

Key fields:

one_sentence_intent

top_priorities[]

constraints[]

focus_rules[]

decision_queue[]

carryovers_from_yesterday[]

1.3 EveningDebrief

Represents actual outcomes + saved state.

Key fields:

one_paragraph_summary

score (outcome/focus/energy)

worked_on[]

shipped[]

decisions[]

learnings[]

problems[]

carryovers[]

tomorrow_seed[]

2) Activity entities

2.1 WorkBlock

A unit of work tied to a project and outcome.

Key fields:

project (e.g., NS-PG)

type (doc|code|infra|ops|research|design|decision|meeting|admin)

what_i_did

result

time_spent_minutes

links[]

Rules:

At least one WorkBlock must exist in every EveningDebrief.

2.2 ShippedItem

A durable artifact that exists now.

Key fields:

title

type (doc|code|decision|infra|research|ops)

impact (tiny|small|medium|large|critical)

project (optional but recommended)

link

Interpretation:

“Shipped” means it can be referenced later (doc ID, repo, PR, ticket, etc.).

3) Cognition entities

3.1 Decision

A committed directional choice.

Key fields:

title

class (naming|architecture|security|operations|product|people|finance|legal)

status (draft|made|reversed)

context

choice

rationale

consequences

project (recommended)

link

Identity rule:

A Decision should be stable across days if revisited (same title, new status or note).

3.2 Learning

A durable insight.

Key fields:

what_i_learned

how_it_changes_tomorrow

project (optional)

link

3.3 Problem

A failure/degradation and a corrective idea.

Key fields:

what_went_wrong

root_cause_hypothesis

fix_next_time

project (optional)

link

4) Continuity entities

4.1 Carryover

An explicit open loop handed forward.

Key fields:

title

next_action

priority (high|medium|low)

carryover_type (execution|decision|research|waiting|bug|risk)

blocker (optional)

project (recommended)

link

Rules:

Every Carryover must have a next_action.

Carryovers are the primary feed into quickscope.

4.2 TomorrowSeed

A lightweight candidate priority for the next MorningBrief.

Key fields:

title

why

project (optional)

5) Relationship graph (how entities connect)

The canonical relationships are:

Day → MorningBrief / EveningDebrief

EveningDebrief → WorkBlocks / ShippedItems / Decisions / Learnings / Problems / Carryovers

WorkBlock → Project

ShippedItem → Project (recommended)

Decision → Project (recommended)

Carryover → Project (recommended)

Cross-day relationships:

Carryover(Day N) → Carryover(Day N+1) (same title lineage)

Decision(Day N) → Decision(Day N+K) (revisit lineage)

6) Canonical IDs (recommended, optional)

To support ingestion, NS-CHRONICLE can optionally include IDs.

6.1 Suggested ID formats

day_id = YYYY-MM-DD

workblock_id = YYYY-MM-DD::<project>::WB::<n>

ship_id = YYYY-MM-DD::<project>::SHIP::<slug>

decision_id = <project>::DEC::<slug>

carryover_id = <project>::CO::<slug>

If you don’t want to add IDs to XML, engines can generate them deterministically.

7) Event mapping to engines

7.1 quickscope (Intervention)

Input: Carryovers

Mapping:

Carryover → OpenLoopTask

fields: title, next_action, priority, blocker, link, project

Derived metrics:

carryover aging (days open)

closure rate

priority distribution

7.2 GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Input: Decisions + governance artifacts

Mapping:

Decision → DecisionNode

ShippedItem(type=decision|doc) → GovernanceArtifact

Edges:

Decision → Project

Decision → Artifact

Artifact → Project

7.3 DRE (Deep Research Engine)

Input: Research WorkBlocks + Learnings + sources

Mapping:

WorkBlock(type=research) → ResearchSession

Learning → InsightNode

Links → SourceEdge

7.4 LUM

Input: Ops WorkBlocks + Problems

Mapping:

WorkBlock(type=ops) → OperationalEvent

Problem → IncidentNote (or DegradationReport)

8) Derived analytics (what you’ll get “for free”)

Once ingested or indexed, the model supports:

time spent by project / type

shipped artifacts per week

decision velocity (decisions made vs revisited)

carryover aging and closure

focus drift (plan vs actual)

energy/outcome correlation

9) Next document

If you want to continue, next is the natural automation layer:

NS-CHRONICLE-008 — INDEXING + ROLLUPS (daily index.json, weekly rollups, search, time-by-project)

NS-CHRONICLE-005 — DATA MODEL (XML Schemas + Validation)

This document defines the data model for NS-CHRONICLE: the XML schemas, required fields, enumerations, and validation rules that keep the system consistent and ingestible.

NS-CHRONICLE intentionally uses two artifacts per day:

MorningBrief

EveningDebrief

1) Data model goals

Deterministic: stable fields so parsing never breaks

Minimal but sufficient: capture only what drives continuity

Ingestible: clean mapping into GGE / DRE / quickscope

Human-friendly: writable by hand and by ChatGPT

2) Common conventions

2.1 Required meta fields

Both artifacts must include:

Meta/Date (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)

Meta/Timezone (default America/New_York)

Meta/Author (e.g., John)

Meta/Version (schema version, e.g., 1.0)

2.2 Optional meta extensions

Allowed optional nodes:

Meta/Tags (free text tags)

Meta/Source (e.g., chatgpt, manual)

2.3 Uncertainty

If the generator is unsure, include:

<Uncertain>true</Uncertain>

inside the node that is uncertain.

2.4 Time units

All time values are minutes:

TimeSpentMinutes

TimeBoxMinutes

3) Schema: MorningBrief

3.1 Structure

Required top-level sections:

Meta

Context

TodayPlan

Mindset

3.2 Required fields

MorningBrief is considered valid if it contains:

Meta/Date

Context/OneSentenceIntent

At least one TodayPlan/TopPriorities/Priority

3.3 Nodes

3.3.1 TopPriorities/Priority

Fields:

Title (required)

OutcomeDefinition (required)

3.3.4 FocusRules/Rule

Fields:

3.3.5 Mindset

4) Schema: EveningDebrief

4.1 Structure

Required top-level sections:

Meta

Summary

WhatIWorkedOn

Continuity

Optional sections:

WhatIShipped

Decisions

Learnings

Problems

Closeout

4.2 Required fields

EveningDebrief is considered valid if it contains:

Meta/Date

Summary/OneParagraphFromMyPerspective

At least one WhatIWorkedOn/WorkBlock

At least one carryover OR an explicit “none” signal:

either Continuity/Carryovers/Item exists

or Continuity/Carryovers exists with <None>true</None>

4.3 Nodes

4.3.1 WhatIWorkedOn/WorkBlock

Fields:

Project (required; should be from NS-CHRONICLE-002)

WhatIDid (required)

Result (optional)

TimeSpentMinutes (optional)

Links (optional)

4.3.2 WhatIShipped/Item

Fields:

Title (required)

Type (enum; see Section 5)

Impact (enum; see Section 5)

Link (optional)

4.3.3 Decisions/Decision

Fields:

Title (required)

Context (optional)

Choice (required)

Rationale (required)

Consequences (optional)

Link (optional)

4.3.4 Learnings/Learning

Fields:

WhatILearned (required)

HowItChangesTomorrow (optional)

4.3.5 Problems/Problem

Fields:

WhatWentWrong (required)

RootCauseHypothesis (optional)

FixNextTime (optional)

4.3.6 Continuity/Carryovers/Item

Fields:

Title (required)

NextAction (required)

Priority (enum: high|medium|low)

Blocker (optional)

Link (optional)

CarryoverType (optional enum; see Section 5)

4.3.7 Summary/Score

Fields:

Outcome (0–10)

Focus (0–10)

Energy (0–10)

5) Enumerations (authoritative)

These enums should match NS-CHRONICLE-002.

5.1 Work types

Allowed Type values:

doc|code|infra|ops|research|design|decision|meeting|admin

5.2 Impact scale

Allowed Impact values:

tiny|small|medium|large|critical

5.3 CarryoverType

Allowed CarryoverType values:

execution|decision|research|waiting|bug|risk

5.4 Priority

Allowed Priority values:

high|medium|low

6) Validation rules (the “musts”)

6.1 Global rules

Do not store secrets.

Every major item should include at least one evidence link when possible.

Prefer taxonomy enums; if unknown leave empty.

6.2 MorningBrief rules

Max 3 TopPriorities (strong recommendation)

Every priority must have an OutcomeDefinition

Every carryover must have a NextAction

6.3 EveningDebrief rules

Every carryover must have a NextAction

At least one WorkBlock must include Project

If you shipped nothing, include <WhatIShipped><None>true</None></WhatIShipped>

7) Ingestion mapping (CHRONICLE → Engines)

This is the canonical mapping if/when you ingest Chronicle into your systems.

7.1 quickscope (Intervention)

Continuity/Carryovers/Item → state transitions / open-loop tasks

key fields: Title, NextAction, Priority, Blocker, Link

7.2 GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Decisions/Decision → decision nodes

WhatIShipped/Item of Type=decision|doc → governance artifacts

link edges: decision → project → artifact

7.3 DRE (Deep Research Engine)

WorkBlocks with Type=research (or tagged) + Learnings → research nodes

links become source edges

7.4 LUM

WorkBlocks with Type=ops + Problems/Incidents → operational events

8) Schema evolution (versioning)

Increment Meta/Version when you change field names or enumerations.

Additive fields are allowed without breaking changes.

Avoid renaming nodes; prefer deprecation with dual-write for a few weeks if needed.

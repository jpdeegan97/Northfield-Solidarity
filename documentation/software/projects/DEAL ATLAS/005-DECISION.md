# 005 DECISION

## Key decisions
- Evidence-backed registry: every field can be traced to one or more sources.
- Clear separation of **public vs licensed** data, with enforcement.
- Entity resolution is first-class (aliases, affiliates, funds, SPVs).
- Analytics are derived from normalized schema + relationship graph.

## Open questions
- Which institution types are priority (banks vs PE/VC vs private credit)?
- What time horizon for backfill (3y / 5y / 10y)?
- Do you want performance proxies (marks, exits) only where public?
- Preferred UI: lightweight internal dashboard vs full analyst workstation?

# 000 CHARTER — Deal Atlas (NS-DA)

**Project Code:** NS-DA  
**Project Name:** Deal Atlas  
**Description:** Financial Institution → Funded Deal Registry + Analytics  
**Org:** Northfield Solidarity (NS)  
**Created:** 2025-12-31

## Mission
Given one or more **financial institutions** (banks, private credit shops, VCs/PE, family offices, government lenders), build a **structured registry of funded deals** and provide **analytics** that reveal:
- where and how they deploy capital,
- deal patterns over time,
- sectors/geographies/stages,
- syndication networks and counterparties,
- performance proxies (where public).

## North Star Outcomes
1. **Evidence-backed deal registry** (every record traceable to sources)
2. **Clean entity resolution** (institutions, borrowers/issuers, funds, SPVs)
3. **Powerful analytics** (filters, cohorts, trendlines, network graphs)
4. **Freshness + change tracking** (new deals detected quickly)
5. **Compliance-first ingestion** (ToS/robots respected; licensed sources handled properly)

## Non-negotiables
- Do not bypass access controls or paywalls.
- Respect provider terms and licensing for any data source.
- Clearly label **public** vs **licensed** vs **user-provided** data.
- Avoid collecting/storing sensitive personal data; focus on business/deal info.
- Provide confidence scores and citations for all fields.

## Success Metrics
- Coverage: % of deals captured for target institutions (by timeframe)
- Precision: duplicate/false-match rate below threshold
- Freshness: median time from announcement → registry < 24–72h (source dependent)
- Analyst usefulness: “insight value” rating ≥ 4/5

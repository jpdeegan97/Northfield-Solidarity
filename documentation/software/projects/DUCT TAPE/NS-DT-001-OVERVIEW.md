## What it is
**Duct Tape Sessions** are a structured creative service:
1) You talk without interruption for 30 minutes.
2) We capture audio/video.
3) We process it into a “Build Bundle” (docs + plan + options).
4) You decide what happens next (take it, buy IP, or keep iterating with us).

## The “no interruptions” mechanic
- Everyone in attendance agrees to a clear rule: **no interruptions**.
- We enforce this with friendly physical tokens (wristband, “tape” badge, desk sign).
- The tone is respectful, safe, and professional.

## What you get
A standardized deliverable pack, tailored to the session:
- **Problem & vision** (cleanly articulated)
- **MVP scope** (what to build first)
- **Key decisions** (tradeoffs + rationale)
- **Architecture** (high-level)
- **Roadmap** (30/60/90)
- **Risks & mitigations**
- **IP posture** options (retain, license, or sell)

## Experience flow
- 5 min: setup, consent, objective framing
- 30 min: uninterrupted talk
- 10 min: debrief, clarifying questions (optional)
- Processing: automated pipeline + human QA pass (MVP)
- Delivery: secure link + optional live review call

## Pricing / engagement model (high-level)
- **Session fee**: covers capture + first Build Bundle
- **Daily iteration**: client pays per day for rapid improvements/expansions
- **IP options**:
  - client owns outputs by default (simple model), or
  - license model with buyout option (more scalable)

## Differentiators
- Speed: “idea to usable plan” in hours, not weeks
- Psychological safety: protected speaking space
- Output quality: structured, artifact-driven deliverables
- Optional continuity: daily iteration to turn bundles into real products

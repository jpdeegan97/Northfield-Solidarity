# DT-000 — Charter

**Project:** Duct Tape Sessions  
**Doc ID:** DT-000  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** December 24, 2025

## Mission
Provide an **intimate, interruption-free, 30-minute thinking space** that turns raw verbal “rambling” into a **clean, structured build plan** (POC/MVP blueprint + documentation), delivered fast enough to preserve momentum.

## Product statement
Duct Tape Sessions are private, guided recording sessions in a small setting (friends/family optional) where the speaker gets a protected window of uninterrupted expression. The content is captured (audio/video), processed into structured artifacts, and delivered quickly as a “Build Bundle.”

> “Duct Tape” is a metaphor for “no interruptions.” Physical tape is optional; we can use wristbands/cards/signage.

## Target users
- Founders with too many ideas and not enough structure
- Creators/consultants needing a crisp offer/productization plan
- Operators who need to untangle a complex initiative fast
- Teams wanting a “one person, one mic” clarity exercise

## Core outcomes
1) Speaker feels heard and leaves with clarity  
2) Within hours (MVP target), they receive a usable bundle:
   - POC design, docs, roadmap, key decisions
3) A clear path to engagement:
   - buy IP, license it, or continue iterative build work

## Non-goals
- Therapy or clinical counseling
- Surveillance, covert recording, or “gotcha” content
- Anything sexualized or coercive; professional boundaries always

## Success metrics (MVP)
- Time-to-first-deliverable: **< 2 hours** (stretch), **< 24 hours** baseline
- Client satisfaction (post-session): **≥ 8/10**
- Conversion to next step (IP buyout or build engagement): **≥ 20%**
- Repeat sessions: **≥ 15%** within 60 days
- Processing cost per session decreases over time (automation curve)

## Constraints and principles
- Consent-first: explicit recording + distribution permissions
- Data minimization: only collect what’s needed to produce deliverables
- Fast feedback loops: ship the first bundle fast, then iterate daily
- Quality gating: “instant” output still meets a minimum clarity bar

## Scope
In scope:
- Booking + session facilitation
- Recording capture (audio/video)
- Transcription + summarization + idea extraction
- Automated doc generation + roadmap creation
- Delivery via secure portal + optional daily iteration subscriptions

Out of scope (initially):
- Complex multi-speaker diarization at scale
- Full custom software builds for every client (unless contracted)
- Live-streaming or public publishing

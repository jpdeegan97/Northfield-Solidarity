## Scenario
A solo founder wants to build a lightweight marketplace product but keeps changing ideas daily.

## Step 1 — Intake
- Session type: Founder Burst
- Goal: pick a single wedge + define MVP
- Constraints: 2-week build, low budget
- Audience: 2 trusted friends (silent during monologue)

## Step 2 — Session
- Setup: consent confirmed, “no interruptions” tokens handed out
- 30 minutes: founder speaks freely about problems, users, features, fears
- 10 minutes: facilitator asks 5 clarifying questions

## Step 3 — Processing (MVP pipeline)
1) Ingest media, create checksums
2) Transcribe audio
3) Extract:
   - target user persona
   - core pain points
   - constraints and non-negotiables
4) Generate bundle v1.0:
   - requirements outline
   - MVP scope list
   - architecture sketch
   - 30/60/90 roadmap
   - decision log
5) QA pass: remove sensitive names, tighten ambiguous claims

## Step 4 — Delivery
Client receives portal link with:
- DT bundle v1.0 (MD + PDF)
- “Next steps” options:
  - keep bundle (done)
  - buy IP (assignment)
  - daily iteration for a week

## Step 5 — Iteration Day
Client pays for 1 iteration day:
- bundle v1.1 adds:
  - competitor comparison notes (if requested)
  - backlog in priority order
  - API map draft

## Step 6 — Closeout
- IP posture finalized
- retention timer starts
- deletion option explained

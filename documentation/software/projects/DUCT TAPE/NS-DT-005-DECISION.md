## Decision principles
- Favor speed to first value, then iterate quality
- Safety, consent, and privacy are first-class requirements
- Outputs must be structured and reusable (docs-as-product)

## Key decisions (v1)
1) **Uninterrupted monologue length**
   - Default: 30 minutes
   - Rationale: long enough for flow state, short enough for processing cost

2) **Capture format**
   - MVP: single camera + high quality audio
   - Rationale: audio drives transcription quality; video is optional value

3) **Delivery SLA**
   - MVP: same-day “instant” bundle (best-effort), otherwise < 24 hours
   - Rationale: keep momentum while maintaining a minimal QA bar

4) **IP posture**
   - Default: client owns deliverables unless otherwise contracted
   - Option: license + buyout (for scalable productization)

5) **Audience participation**
   - Audience present but silent during monologue
   - Optional Q&A after; facilitator controls timing

6) **Conduct boundary**
   - No coercion, harassment, or sexualized conduct
   - Clear removal policy + session termination rights for safety

7) **Data retention**
   - Default retention window defined in DT-014
   - Easy deletion request path (DT-013 runbook)

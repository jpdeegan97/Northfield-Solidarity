NS-FIRMAMENT-001 — OVERVIEW

Project: Firmament (3D Operations Globe)Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)Authority: GGE (Governance Graph Engine)Status: Draft v0.1

1. What Firmament Is

Firmament is a real-time, zoomable 3D Earth that visualizes Northfield Solidarity’s business reality as layered operational truth.

It is a situational awareness + decision cockpit that:

projects what exists (entities, locations, flows),

highlights what’s happening (events, disruptions, performance),

surfaces what matters (risk, opportunity, constraint),

and produces what to do next (action items, mitigations, growth plays),
all while remaining governed by GGE.

2. What Firmament Is Not

Firmament is not:

an ERP replacement

an accounting ledger (FLO is authoritative)

a task manager (CWP is authoritative)

a research engine (DRE/PIE are authoritative)

a governance authority (GGE is authoritative)

a data integration hub (MUX is authoritative)

Firmament is the projection layer that makes the engines legible and actionable through space, time, and sector lenses.

3. Why Firmament Exists

Traditional dashboards fragment reality:

geography is separated from performance,

events are separated from logistics,

strategy is separated from execution,

and “what should I do” is buried in disconnected reports.

Firmament exists to unify these into a single mental model:

Earth is the stable coordinate system

Layers are the analytical lenses

Drilldowns explain the “why”

Actions close the loop into execution systems

4. Primary Use Cases

A) Entity & Logistics Visibility

View NS / SL entities, sites, vendors, customers, and 3PL nodes

See inbound/outbound flows as paths

Click any node → relationships, dependencies, current state, next actions

B) Geo-Linked Events and Readiness

“Upcoming events” list that is automatically projectable on the globe

Each event includes: location, time window, stakeholders, prep checklist, readiness status

C) Sector Health Heatmap → Sector Operating Brief

Sector treemap/heatmap shows sector weight + performance (and other KPIs)

Clicking a sector generates a “Sector Operating Brief”:

what’s going well / what’s failing

contributing root causes across ops/finance/supply/market

prioritized actions with owners and due dates

D) Plan Slider (Risk ↔ Ambition)

A single control that switches operating posture

Changes:

scenario assumptions (SIM)

recommended actions (priority, aggressiveness, spend)

risk controls and governance requirements

E) Real-Time Signal Projection

Signals (SIG) appear as overlays:

disruptions, anomalies, market shifts

“hot spots” on relevant geos and sectors

alert → drilldown → action routing

5. Key Concepts

5.1 Layers

A Layer is a coherent overlay with:

a purpose (what lens it provides)

a geometry type (pins/paths/polygons/heat tiles/treemap)

filters (entity, sector, time window, severity, etc.)

drilldowns (what opens on click)

5.2 Operational Truth Objects

Firmament renders “truth objects” that are stable enough to reason about:

entities

locations

relationships

events

flows

risks/opportunities

sector summaries

action items

5.3 Render-Ready Projections

Firmament stores view-model projections optimized for:

fast rendering

zoom-level changes

caching and streaming
while engines remain the sources of truth.

6. Interfaces to Other Engines

GGE: governance gates, decision traceability, approvals, policy constraints

CWP: ownership, task assignment, work status, accountability

FLO: cost/margin overlays, exposure, runway and budget constraints

SIG: live signals/alerts and anomaly detection outputs

SIM: scenario outputs powering the plan slider

IDN: entity graph identities + relationships

MUX: inbound integrations and external connectors

DRE/PIE/DAT: research insights, opportunity findings, execution tooling outputs

7. Outputs (What Firmament Produces)

Firmament produces:

interactive situational views

sector operating briefs

ranked action lists

scenario-differentiated plans

governance-ready decision packets (when a move requires gating)

8. MVP Boundaries (v0 → v1)

v0 (first useful)

globe + layers

entity/logistics layer

events layer

sector heatmap + operating brief

action routing into CWP + gating via GGE

v1 (powerful)

multi-scenario timeline playback

“mission mode” views (campaigns, launches, sourcing pushes)

predictive hot spots (SIG→SIM)

richer financial overlays (FLO) by geo + sector

automated brief generation with stronger causal attribution

9. Summary

Firmament is the visual cognition surface for Northfield Solidarity: a 3D Earth that turns your engines’ outputs into spatial, temporal, sector-aware operational clarity — and converts clarity into governed action.

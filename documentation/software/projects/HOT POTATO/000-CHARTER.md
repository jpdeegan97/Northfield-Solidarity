# 000 CHARTER — Hot Potato (NS-HP)

**Project Code:** NS-HP  
**Project Name:** Hot Potato  
**Description:** Hot Lead Generator + CWP (Conversion Workflow Playbook)  
**Org:** Northfield Solidarity (NS)  
**Created:** 2025-12-31

## Mission
Generate **high-quality, permission-aware B2B leads** and produce:
1) an **evidence-backed business intelligence brief** per lead, and  
2) a **Conversion Workflow Playbook (CWP)** that guides operator-led interactions through a sequenced plan of actions/messages.

## What “Hot” means
A lead is “hot” when it has:
- credible **need / intent signals** (permits, RFPs, hiring, expansion),
- plausible **budget/funding signals** (public or opt-in),
- an identifiable **decision-maker path** (roles/titles + org signals),
- strong fit for your target market,
- lawful contactability under applicable rules and platform terms.

## CWP: “Guaranteed Conversion” (reframed safely)
Internally, “guaranteed conversion” means **high-probability conversion engineering**:
- consistent research quality,
- value-first sequencing,
- ethical persuasion (clarity + relevance + proof),
- strong compliance gates,
- iterative learning from outcomes.

No system can guarantee another human’s decision. Hot Potato optimizes for:
- reply rate, meeting rate, qualified conversion rate, time-to-conversion.

## Non-Negotiables (Safety + Compliance)
- **No illegal access / no bypassing controls** (no paywall or auth circumvention).
- **ToS/robots compliant** sources only.
- **Evidence-first**: every non-trivial claim must cite an evidence record.
- **Data minimization** and retention discipline.
- **No deceptive outreach** (no impersonation, fake urgency, misleading claims).
- **Respect consent**: global opt-out suppression.
- **No sensitive profiling**: do not infer/store sensitive personal traits (health, religion, politics, etc.).
- **Human approval before outreach** (Phase 1/2).

### Sensitive fields you listed (credit score, bankruptcy)
These are **highly regulated / sensitive** and can implicate consumer-reporting rules.
Hot Potato supports them only under strict, safe conditions:
- **Credit score:** only self-reported with explicit consent + permissible purpose.
- **Bankruptcy:** only lawful public records (if used), with case/date/source and retention controls.
Tier-3 is **disabled by default**.

## Success Metrics
- Lead validity ≥ 95%
- Brief usefulness ≥ 4/5 (operator rating)
- Complaint/opt-out incident rate ~0
- Improved conversion metrics vs non-CWP outreach

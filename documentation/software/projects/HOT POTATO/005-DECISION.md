# 005 DECISION

## Key decisions
- Safer Leads Mode is default (public + opt-in)
- Evidence-backed briefs and CWP artifacts (“cite or omit”)
- Human approval before outreach/export (initial)
- Ethical persuasion only: no deception, no sensitive profiling
- Global suppression on opt-out

## “Psychological approach” guidelines (safe)
Allowed:
- role-based communication strategy (e.g., ROI framing for CFO, risk framing for compliance)
- clarity, relevance, proof, and permission-based outreach
Not allowed:
- sensitive trait inference, manipulation, coercion, or deception

## Open questions
- Define conversion event (meeting? signed? paid?)
- Channel mix (email/phone/forms/LinkedIn manual)
- Default value artifacts library

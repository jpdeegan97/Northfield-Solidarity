## Operator Console (Hot Potato + CWP)

### Lead ops
- Lead queue (fit/intent/risk)
- Business profile and evidence viewer
- Brief editor (highlight uncited statements)
- Approve/export controls

### CWP ops
- “Generate CWP” (CR + PM + CT) for an approved lead
- Side-by-side view:
  - Company Report
  - Personnel Map (stakeholder roles + contact paths)
  - Proposed Conversion Timeline (editable steps)
- Outreach asset drafts per step (email/call script) + tone selector
- Execution checklist + outcome capture after each touch

### Safety UX
- Red flags panel (compliance + uncertainty)
- One-click opt-out/suppression
- Blocking rules: cannot activate timeline if opt-out exists or evidence gate fails

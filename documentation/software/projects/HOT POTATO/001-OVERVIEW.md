# 001 OVERVIEW

## One-liner
Hot Potato turns “candidate businesses” into **ranked, compliant leads** with **evidence-backed intelligence briefs** and an operator-ready **CWP interaction timeline**.

## Two major layers
### A) Lead Intelligence Layer
- approved-source lead collection
- identity resolution + dedupe
- enrichment (firmographics + intent + org signals)
- evidence-backed company brief

### B) Conversion Workflow Playbook (CWP)
- company report + personnel map (public/professional only)
- decision-maker path and outreach strategy selection
- sequenced “best next actions” with branching gates
- draft outreach assets (email/call scripts) for operator review
- outcome tracking and learning

## Primary workflows
1) Batch ingest → enrich → brief → score → review → export  
2) Generate CWP → operator executes touches → outcomes recorded  
3) Feedback loop → scoring + sequencing improve over time

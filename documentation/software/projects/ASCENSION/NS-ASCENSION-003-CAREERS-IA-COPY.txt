Ascension page copy (draft)
Ascension is our hiring journey: a sequence of doors from the edge of the Firmament to the Center. Each gate is designed to confirm one thing: you can ship with us.
Gate 0 — The Signal — Application as a ‘ping’ from outside the Firmament.
Gate 1 — The Echo — Async proof: portfolio, written answers, or short loom.
Gate 2 — The Trial — A small, paid challenge (time-boxed, scoped, repeatable).
Gate 3 — The Alignment — Operating style + values + communication calibration.
Gate 4 — The Door — Final live session: deep dive + mutual fit.
Gate 5 — The Center — The final landing: intentional conversation + decision.

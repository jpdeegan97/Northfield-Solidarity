CONCORD (site sync)
Careers IA, role pages, and Ascension gate map live in CONCORD registry.
Any change to gates/copy/roles triggers regeneration and drift checks.
SANCTUM (timeline)
Each candidate progression emits Sanctum events (gate_entered, gate_passed, trial_sent, offer_made, hired).
Sanctum becomes the narrative record: Ascension journeys per role/cycle.
CADENCE (scheduling)
Interview blocks and review windows can be produced as calendar events.
Trial deadlines and feedback SLAs can be exported as ICS feeds.

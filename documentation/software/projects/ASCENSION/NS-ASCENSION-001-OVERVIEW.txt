NS-ASCENSION-001-OVERVIEW

NS-ASCENSION is both a brand story and a practical hiring funnel.
The metaphor
NS is a Firmament. Candidates begin outside it. Each gate is a closed door that opens only when signal is strong. The Center is the final landing: an intentional conversation and decision.
The practical funnel
Each gate has a purpose, expected time commitment, and explicit rubric.
Progression is quick; feedback is concise; trials are paid where feasible.
The process scales: per-role templates + shared infrastructure.
Candidate promise
No ambiguity: you’ll always know where you are in the gates.
No hidden tests: criteria and deliverables are stated.
Respect: time-boxed tasks and paid work for meaningful effort.

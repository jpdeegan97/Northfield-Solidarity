NSDC Engine Charter — SIM (Simulation & Scenario Engine)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Simulation & Scenario Engine
Acronym: SIM
Engine Type: Modeling / Forecasting / Analysis
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to simulate, model, and analyze potential scenarios and system behaviors within NSDC, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic forecasting across engines and projects.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Build models to simulate capital deployment, arbitrage opportunities, and market behavior
  Run scenario analyses to forecast outcomes under different assumptions
  Evaluate risk and performance implications of potential actions
  Provide insights to DAT, PIE, FLO, and other engines for planning and decision-making
  Maintain historical simulation records for backtesting and validation
  Support stress testing of system-wide processes and governance rules
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Execute actual trades or arbitrage opportunities (DAT)
  Govern compliance or capital thresholds (GGP)
  Generate canonical product intelligence (PIE)
  Publish content or manage engagement (CDE)
  Record financial ledgers (FLO)
SIM only simulates and analyzes; it does not perform operational actions.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
SIM May Decide Autonomously:
  How to model scenarios and parameters
  Which scenarios to prioritize for analysis
  Risk scoring and outcome evaluation
SIM Must Not Decide:
  Actual capital deployment or execution timing
  Governance enforcement
  Product or content strategies
SIM is a forecasting and analysis engine, not an executor.
8. Governance & Constraints
  All simulation and scenario data must comply with GGP rules
  Models must be auditable and reproducible
  Scenario assumptions and parameters must be clearly documented
  Outputs must not bypass governance or execution layers
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Modeling inaccuracies
  Incomplete scenario coverage
  Data inconsistency or missing inputs
Worst-Case Failure:
  Downstream engines make suboptimal decisions based on flawed scenarios
  Misestimated risk or capital exposure
Blast Radius:
  Primarily affects planning and decision-making outcomes; no direct operational or financial impact
Containment strategy:
  Versioned simulation models
  Validation and sensitivity analysis
  Alerts for anomalous scenario results
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Accuracy, predictive power, and scenario coverage
  Time Horizon: Strategic to near-term planning; real-time optional for stress testing
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Product and market identifiers (PIE)
  Execution references (DAT)
  Financial metrics and ledgers (FLO)
  Governance flags and policies (GGP)
  Signal datasets (SIG)
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Basic scenario simulation with historical data
  Risk evaluation and outcome reports
  Integration with DAT, PIE, FLO for scenario inputs and outputs
  Historical archives for backtesting
MVP Excludes:
  Real-time adaptive simulation with predictive AI
  Full-scale multi-market optimization beyond MVP scope
  Automated capital allocation or action execution
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Historical data-driven scenario modeling
  Phase 2: Multi-variable and cross-engine simulations
  Phase 3: Predictive, adaptive, and AI-assisted scenario planning

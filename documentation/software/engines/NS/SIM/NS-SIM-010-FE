Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the optional frontend (FE) / operator UI for the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM).
The SIM operator UI exists to:
provide visibility into scenario requests, runs, and outcomes
make assumptions, constraints, and model versions explicit
support governed controls (run, replay, re-execute)
enable side-by-side scenario comparison and sensitivity review
SIM FE is analysis-first, control second.
2. FE Design Principles
No Hidden Assumptions — assumptions must be visible and exportable
Immutability Respect — prior runs cannot be edited
Explainability Default — drivers and constraints are first-class
Governed Controls — reruns require identity and reason
Comparison-Centric — core workflow is A/B scenario comparison
3. Primary Personas
Operator / Analyst — runs scenarios and compares variants
Decision Maker — reviews risk and breakpoints
Auditor — verifies determinism and provenance
Governance Reviewer — consumes scenario context for approvals
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Scenario Dashboard
Goal: a single place to see scenario inventory and recent runs.
Displays:
scenario list (type, intent, status)
recent runs (completed/failed)
top risk flags (constraint breaches)
4.2 Scenario Builder (Guided)
Goal: create baseline + variants safely.
Sections:
link PIE insight(s)
select horizon and time-step
add assumptions (explicit deltas)
attach constraints (FLO/ops/governance)
choose model package version
Outcome: scenario request, not execution.
4.3 Run Queue & Job Monitor
Goal: monitor queued/running/completed jobs.
Displays:
job status timeline
execution duration
failure reasons
Actions (Governed):
cancel job
retry job
4.4 Scenario Run Detail
Goal: inspect a single run with full explainability.
Sections:
input snapshot hash
model versions used
RNG seed
assumptions and constraints
outcomes (time-series charts)
breakpoint events (constraint breaches)
4.5 Comparison View (Core)
Goal: compare baseline vs variants.
Features:
overlay time-series outcomes
show deltas at checkpoints (day 7/30/90)
highlight risk exposure differences
show constraint breakpoints side-by-side
4.6 Sensitivity & Driver View
Goal: make “what matters most” explicit.
Displays:
ranked sensitivity drivers
directionality
confidence bands
4.7 Replay & Re-Execution Console (Governed)
Goal: deterministic replay and comparative re-execution.
Job Types:
replay (same snapshot + versions)
re-execute (same snapshot, new models)
Required:
actor identity
reason
governance reference (when required)
4.8 Export & Audit Pack Generator
Goal: generate a package for governance review.
Contents:
scenario definition
assumptions + constraints
run summary
sensitivity drivers
breakpoints
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
ScenarioTable
ScenarioBuilderWizard
AssumptionEditor (delta-only)
ConstraintCard
RunJobTimeline
OutcomeChartPanel
BreakpointEventList
CompareOverlayPanel
SensitivityRankTable
GovernedActionModal
AuditPackExporter
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
list scenarios
create scenario request
list runs + statuses
get run detail + artifacts
compare runs
trigger replay / re-execute jobs
export audit pack
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: fast comparison and chart rendering
Security: RBAC on governed actions and financial constraints
Auditability: all actions logged with reason
Clarity: baseline vs variants always explicit

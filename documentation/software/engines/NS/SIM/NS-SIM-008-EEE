Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides a concrete end-to-end example (EEE) demonstrating how the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM) operates across its lifecycle.
The example validates:
scenario initiation from PIE insights
input snapshot assembly from SIG/DAT/FLO
scenario construction (baseline + variants)
deterministic execution under constraints
uncertainty and sensitivity artifacts
downstream consumption by GGP and DAT
replay and comparative re-execution
2. Scenario Narrative
Narrative:
PIE surfaces an insight suggesting a new product listing opportunity. Before execution, SIM models multiple futures to assess risk and expected outcomes.
Goal:
quantify downside risk
identify breakpoints (where the plan fails)
expose key sensitivity drivers
3. Inputs
3.1 PIE Insight
insight_id = PIE-INS-123
opportunity: “List Product X in Market Y with paid ads”
supporting signals: rising keyword velocity + competitor price gap
3.2 SIG Observed Reality
demand aggregates (search volume, CTR, conversion rate)
market signals (competitor price observed)
supply signals (stock availability signals)
3.3 DAT Execution Parameters
channel plan: marketplace listing + ads
spend schedule: $150/day for 14 days
fulfillment method and estimated costs
3.4 FLO Financial Constraints
max daily burn: $250/day
minimum cash reserve: $5,000
max inventory exposure: $8,000
4. Step-by-Step Simulation Lifecycle
5. Step 1 — Scenario Initiation
A scenario request is created:
scenario_type = comparative
initiator = operator
references PIE insight PIE-INS-123
requested horizon = 90 days
SIM performs Scenario Admission Decision:
outcome: admit
rationale: input references valid
A sim_decision artifact is recorded.
6. Step 2 — Input Snapshot Assembly
SIM assembles a frozen snapshot:
SIG references: signal IDs + aggregate IDs + versions
PIE reference: insight ID + version
DAT references: execution param package version
FLO references: capital state version
A snapshot hash is computed:
snapshot_hash = H(snapshot)
Snapshot is immutable.
7. Step 3 — Scenario Construction
SIM creates:
Baseline
no new listing
demand continues per SIG trend
Variant A (Action-Driven)
listing + $150/day ads
Variant B (Stress Test)
Variant A + demand drop shock (-25%) at day 21
Constraints applied:
burn limit
minimum reserve
inventory exposure cap
8. Step 4 — Model Selection
SIM selects models:
demand projection model v1.0
conversion model v1.0
cost model v1.0
Decision recorded:
model selection decision
9. Step 5 — Execution (Deterministic)
Simulation executed with:
time step = daily
seeded RNG = 424242
Produces time-series:
revenue
spend
profit
inventory drawdown
cash reserve
No side effects occur.
10. Step 6 — Constraint & Risk Evaluation
During Variant B, demand shock causes:
slower revenue growth
reserve approaching minimum threshold
Constraint violation detected:
min cash reserve breached at day 38
SIM annotates:
breakpoint = day 38
failure mode: “cash reserve breach”
11. Step 7 — Outcome Packaging
SIM persists:
scenario_run records (baseline, variant A, variant B)
outcome_series (time-series)
uncertainty_artifacts (CI bands)
sensitivity_artifacts
Artifacts reference:
snapshot_hash
model versions
random_seed
12. Step 8 — Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity results show:
conversion_rate
ad_CPC
demand_growth_rate
These become the “what matters most” explanation.
13. Step 9 — Governance Review
SIM publishes scenario summary to GGP context:
Variant A: acceptable risk
Variant B: fails under shock, breakpoint day 38
GGP uses this as approval context.
14. Step 10 — Execution Planning Refinement
DAT consumes results:
recommends reducing spend after day 14 unless conversion improves
proposes a stop-loss threshold for reserve
SIM does not execute; it informs.
15. Step 11 — Deterministic Replay
An auditor replays Variant A:
identical snapshot
identical model versions
identical RNG seed
Expected: identical outputs.
Replay produces matching hashes.
16. Step 12 — Comparative Re-Execution (Model Upgrade)
A new conversion model v1.1 is released.
SIM re-executes:
same snapshot
model v1.1
New run results are stored as a new scenario_run.
Historical runs remain unchanged.
17. Failure Case Example
Model error occurs:
cost model fails for missing parameter
SIM:
marks run failed
preserves partial outputs
records failure decision artifact
No other runs affected.
18. Validation Outcomes
This EEE validates that SIM:
constructs governed scenarios from upstream inputs
freezes deterministic snapshots
enforces constraints
produces explainable, version-bound results
supports replay and re-execution

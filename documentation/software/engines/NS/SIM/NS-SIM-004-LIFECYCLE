Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the end-to-end lifecycle of simulations within the Simulation & Scenario Engine (SIM).
It specifies how scenarios are:
initiated
constructed
executed
evaluated
persisted
reviewed
replayed
The SIM lifecycle is designed to be deterministic, auditable, and governance-aware, while remaining isolated from execution.
2. High-Level Lifecycle Stages
Scenario Initiation
Input Snapshot Assembly
Scenario Construction
Simulation Execution
Constraint & Risk Evaluation
Outcome Packaging
Governance Review & Consumption
Replay, Comparison, and Re-Execution
3. Stage 1 — Scenario Initiation
A simulation begins with a scenario initiation request.
Initiators may include:
Human operators
GGP-governed automation
Downstream engines (request-only)
Initiation requires:
scenario intent
reference insight(s) (PIE)
target decision context
No simulation begins implicitly.
4. Stage 2 — Input Snapshot Assembly
SIM assembles a frozen input snapshot, including:
SIG signal and aggregate references
PIE insight artifacts
DAT execution parameters
FLO financial constraints
All inputs are captured by ID and version.
The snapshot is immutable and hash-addressed.
5. Stage 3 — Scenario Construction
SIM constructs the scenario artifacts:
baseline scenario (observed reality)
assumption sets (explicit deltas)
constraint sets (hard limits)
scenario variants
All assumptions and overrides are explicit.
6. Stage 4 — Simulation Execution
SIM executes the simulation:
advances time in discrete or continuous steps
updates variables according to models
applies deterministic stochastic elements (seeded)
Execution produces time-series state trajectories.
SIM never performs side effects.
7. Stage 5 — Constraint & Risk Evaluation
During execution, SIM evaluates:
constraint violations
resource exhaustion
failure modes
Outcomes:
annotate scenarios with breakpoints
compute risk exposure metrics
Constraints affect simulation paths, not reality.
8. Stage 6 — Outcome Packaging
SIM packages results into immutable artifacts:
scenario_run
outcome_series
uncertainty bands
sensitivity artifacts
Each artifact references:
input snapshot hash
model versions
execution parameters
9. Stage 7 — Governance Review & Consumption
Completed scenarios are:
surfaced to humans
provided to GGP for approval context
consumed by DAT for planning refinement
SIM outputs do not authorize execution.
10. Stage 8 — Replay, Comparison, and Re-Execution
SIM supports:
Replay
re-run scenario with identical inputs
verify determinism
Comparison
compare multiple scenarios side-by-side
Re-Execution
re-run with updated model versions
New runs produce new artifacts; originals remain preserved.
11. Failure Handling
Failures may occur due to:
invalid inputs
model errors
constraint conflicts
Failure handling:
mark scenario_run as failed
preserve partial outputs
record rationale and logs
Failures do not impact other scenarios.
12. Cross-Engine Lifecycle Coordination
Engine
Interaction
PIE
Supplies insights for scenario initiation
SIG
Supplies observed data for baselines
DAT
Supplies execution parameters
FLO
Supplies financial constraints
GGP
Governs scenario usage
PTE
Compares outcomes vs reality

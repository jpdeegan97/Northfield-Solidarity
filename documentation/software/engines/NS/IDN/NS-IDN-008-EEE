Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides a concrete end-to-end example (EEE) demonstrating how identities and entities flow through the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
The example validates:
canonical identity creation
identifier resolution and conflict handling
relationship modeling with temporal semantics
governed merge operations
auditability and replay
2. Scenario Overview
Scenario:
A new property investment initiative is initiated by an internal agent. The system must:
create actor and entity identities
resolve overlapping identifiers
establish ownership and management relationships
detect and resolve a duplicate entity
preserve full audit history
3. Step 1 — Actor Creation (Agent Provisioning)
Trigger: CWP provisions a new agent.
Input:
actor_type = agent
external_id = cwp-agent-042
IDN Actions:
Validate request
Create canonical actor_id = A-1001
Link identifier (cwp_agent_id:cwp-agent-042)
Emit IdentityCreated event
Result:
Actor A-1001 exists
Identifier linked with confidence = 1.0
4. Step 2 — Entity Creation (Property via PECA)
Trigger: PECA creates a new property entity.
Input:
entity_type = property
address = "123 Market St"
county_id = CNTY-7788
IDN Actions:
Validate entity attributes
Create canonical entity_id = E-2001
Link identifiers (address hash, county ID)
Emit EntityCreated event
Result:
Property entity E-2001 created
5. Step 3 — Relationship Creation
Trigger: DAT assigns management responsibility.
Input:
relationship_type = manages
source = actor A-1001
target = entity E-2001
IDN Actions:
Validate actor/entity existence
Validate relationship type
Create relationship edge with effective_from = now
Emit RelationshipAdded event
Result:
A-1001 manages E-2001
6. Step 4 — Identifier Conflict Detection
Trigger: SIG ingests a signal referencing property with same county ID but different address spelling.
Input:
identifier_type = county_id
identifier_value = CNTY-7788
IDN Actions:
Detect identifier collision
Flag ambiguity
Create conflict decision artifact
Quarantine linking
Result:
No silent reassignment
Merge evaluation required
7. Step 5 — Governed Merge Operation
Trigger: Human review confirms entities are the same.
Input:
entities: E-2001 and E-2009
governance_ref = GGP-APR-556
IDN Actions:
Validate merge request
Record merge decision artifact
Emit IdentityMerged event
Redirect E-2009 → E-2001
Preserve historical references
Result:
Single canonical entity E-2001
E-2009 remains as alias
8. Step 6 — Projection Updates
Actions:
Update identifier → canonical lookup
Update relationship adjacency view
Projections reflect new canonical truth.
9. Step 7 — Downstream Consumption
SIM binds scenarios to E-2001
FLO accounts financials under E-2001
PIE groups insights by E-2001
GGP audits merge rationale
No downstream engine stores identity snapshots.
10. Step 8 — Replay & Audit
Audit Query:
Why does identifier CNTY-7788 map to E-2001?
Answer via IDN:
IdentifierLinked event
ConflictDetected decision
Merge decision artifact
Governance reference
Replay yields identical state.
11. Invariants Demonstrated
Canonical IDs are stable
No silent identity mutation
Temporal relationships preserved
Merge history retained
Deterministic replay supported

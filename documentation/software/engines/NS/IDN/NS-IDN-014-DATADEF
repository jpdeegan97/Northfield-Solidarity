Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical data definitions (DATADEF) for the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
It provides:
semantic meaning of each core field
invariants and constraints
cross-engine usage expectations
authoritative reference for audits and integrations
This document is the field-level contract complementing NS-IDN-007 — DATAMODEL.
2. DATADEF Principles
Semantic Immutability — field meaning never changes
Canonical IDs Only — cross-engine references use canonical IDs
Temporal Explicitness — time-bound fields are explicit
Explainability — every mutation has rationale
Audit Completeness — no derived-only truth
3. Actor Data Definitions
3.1 actor
Field
Definition
Notes
actor_id
Canonical actor identifier
Stable forever
actor_type
Classification of actor
human / agent / service / org
status
Current lifecycle state
active / suspended / retired
created_at
Creation timestamp (UTC)
Immutable
Invariants:
actor_id never changes
status transitions are governed
4. Entity Data Definitions
4.1 entity
Field
Definition
Notes
entity_id
Canonical entity identifier
Stable forever
entity_type
Entity classification
legal / property / product / account / concept
lifecycle_state
Entity lifecycle
proposed / active / archived
created_at
Creation timestamp (UTC)
Immutable
Invariants:
entity_id never changes
lifecycle_state changes are explicit
5. Identifier Data Definitions
5.1 identifier
Field
Definition
Notes
identifier_id
Identifier record ID
Internal
identifier_type
Type of identifier
email / tax_id / platform_id
identifier_value
Normalized identifier value
Case/format normalized
issuing_system
Source system
Required
confidence_score
Confidence in correctness
Optional
created_at
When identifier observed
UTC
Invariants:
identifier_value is immutable
identifiers are never reassigned silently
6. Identifier Link Definitions
6.1 identity_identifier_link
Field
Definition
Notes
subject_type
actor or entity
Required
subject_id
Canonical ID
actor_id or entity_id
identifier_id
Linked identifier
FK
linked_at
Link timestamp
UTC
unlinked_at
Unlink timestamp
Nullable
Semantics:
unlinked_at indicates deprecation, not deletion
7. Relationship Data Definitions
7.1 relationship
Field
Definition
Notes
relationship_id
Relationship identifier
Internal
source_type
actor/entity
Required
source_id
Canonical source ID
Stable
target_type
actor/entity
Required
target_id
Canonical target ID
Stable
relationship_type
Edge meaning
owns / manages / controls
effective_from
Start of validity
UTC
effective_to
End of validity
Nullable
Invariants:
open relationships have effective_to = null
updates close old edges, create new ones
8. Identity Event Definitions
8.1 identity_event
Field
Definition
Notes
event_id
Event identifier
Immutable
event_type
Type of identity change
Created / Linked / Merged / Split
subject_ref
Affected canonical
actor_id / entity_id
payload
Event-specific data
JSON
ruleset_name
Logic set used
Required
ruleset_version
Version of logic
Required
occurred_at
When event occurred
UTC
correlation_id
Trace identifier
Required
9. Decision Artifact Definitions
9.1 idn_decision
Field
Definition
Notes
decision_id
Decision identifier
Immutable
decision_type
Creation/link/merge/split
Enumerated
subject_ref
Target of decision
Canonical ID
outcome
Approved / Rejected / Deferred
Explicit
rationale
Structured explanation
JSON
ruleset_version
Decision logic version
Required
evaluated_at
Decision time
UTC
correlation_id
Trace identifier
Required
10. Cross-Engine Contract Expectations
Engine
IDN Contract
GGP
Uses identity + decision artifacts for governance
SIG
Attributes signals using canonical IDs
PIE
Groups insights by entity
SIM
Binds scenarios to entities
DAT
Executes actions on behalf of entities
FLO
Accounts financial state per entity
PECA
Creates new legal/property entities
CWP
Manages agentic actors
Downstream engines must not cache identity snapshots.
11. Validation & Constraints
All timestamps are UTC
Canonical IDs are UUIDs
Identifier uniqueness enforced per (type, value, issuing_system)
Relationship type must be valid for source/target types
12. Backward Compatibility Rules
Fields may be added but never removed
Field meaning never changes
Deprecated fields remain readable
13. Document Position in IDN Corpus
This DATADEF completes the IDN documentation set.
It complements:
NS-IDN-007 — DATAMODEL
NS-IDN-006 — VERSION

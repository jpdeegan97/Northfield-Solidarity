Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the logical and operational architecture of the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
IDN architecture is designed to:
provide authoritative canonical identities and entities
support deterministic identity resolution (merge/split/alias)
maintain a temporal, typed relationship graph
expose fast read surfaces for all engines
enforce write-controls and auditability for identity mutations
2. Architectural Principles
Canonical Authority — IDN is the system-of-record for identity and entity truth
Write-Guarded — merges/splits are governed, not ad-hoc
Append-Only History — identity changes are recorded as events
Temporal Graph — relationships are effective-dated
Read-Optimized — downstream engines query IDN constantly
Explainability — every resolution has a rationale artifact
3. High-Level Architecture
IDN is composed of seven logical layers:
Ingress & Validation Layer
Canonical Registry Layer
Identifier Resolution Layer
Relationship Graph Layer
Event Ledger & Audit Layer
Projection & Read Model Layer
Distribution & Query Layer
4. Ingress & Validation Layer
Responsibilities:
accept identity/entity create requests
validate schemas and constraints
enforce basic invariants (required fields, uniqueness)
Ingress supports:
API requests (operators, system services)
event-driven ingestion (optional, from PECA/CWP)
5. Canonical Registry Layer
Responsibilities:
store canonical Actors and Entities
assign stable IDs
maintain lifecycle status
Canonical records are stable; identity changes occur via events.
6. Identifier Resolution Layer
Responsibilities:
link external identifiers to canonical IDs
maintain confidence and issuing system metadata
evaluate conflicts and ambiguity
Key features:
deterministic resolution rules
conflict detection
governed merge/split workflows
Resolution outputs:
alias links
resolution decision artifacts
7. Relationship Graph Layer
Responsibilities:
maintain typed edges between nodes (actors/entities)
enforce edge constraints
support effective-dated queries
Edges include:
owns
controls
manages
employed_by
Relationships are temporal and versioned.
8. Event Ledger & Audit Layer
Responsibilities:
persist append-only identity events
record resolution decisions
ensure replay and traceability
Events include:
IdentityCreated
IdentifierLinked
IdentityMerged
IdentitySplit
RelationshipAdded
Audit must support “why” as well as “what”.
9. Projection & Read Model Layer
Responsibilities:
build read-optimized projections
maintain fast lookups
support common query patterns
Examples:
identifier → canonical_id map
entity relationship adjacency index
Projections are rebuildable from the event ledger.
10. Distribution & Query Layer
Responsibilities:
expose read-only APIs for downstream engines
provide governed write APIs for controlled changes
publish identity events to Kafka (optional)
Downstream consumers:
GGP, SIG, PIE, SIM, DAT, FLO, CWP, PECA
11. Storage Strategy
Authoritative stores:
PostgreSQL for canonical registry and event ledger
Graph options:
PostgreSQL adjacency tables (MVP)
Optional graph DB later (if required)
Read cache (optional):
Redis for hot identifier lookups
12. Determinism & Replay
IDN supports:
replaying identity state from events
rebuilding projections deterministically
No historical identity is overwritten.
13. Security & Governance Boundaries
Read endpoints broadly available internally
Write endpoints restricted and audited
Merge/split requires governance reference when applicable
IDN does not implement authentication; it consumes verified actor identity.
14. Observability Requirements
Metrics:
identifier resolution latency
conflict rate
merge/split frequency
Logs:
correlation IDs
resolution rationale artifacts

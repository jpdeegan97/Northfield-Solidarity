Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the optional frontend (FE) / operator UI for the Identity & Entity Nexus (IDN).
The IDN operator UI exists to:
search and resolve identities and entities
inspect identifier mappings and confidence
view and edit relationships (governed)
manage merge and split requests (governed)
support audit-grade visibility into identity history
IDN FE is a truth-inspection surface with guarded mutation controls.
2. FE Design Principles
Search First — identity lookup is the primary workflow
No Silent Mutations — merge/split/link changes require explicit actions
Temporal Clarity — relationships show effective windows
Auditability — every change includes actor + reason
Governed Operations — merge/split requires approval reference when configured
3. Primary Personas
Operator — resolves identity ambiguity, links identifiers
Auditor — verifies provenance and rationale
Governance Reviewer — reviews merge/split requests (GGP-linked)
System Engineer — manages projections, rulesets (optional)
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Global Search
Goal: find actors/entities quickly.
Search inputs:
canonical ID
identifier (email, platform_id, tax_id)
name / label
Results:
canonical record preview
best-match confidence
4.2 Actor Detail
Goal: view actor identity truth.
Displays:
actor_id, type, status
identifiers (with issuing system + confidence)
relationship edges (owns/manages/etc.)
event history timeline
Actions (guarded):
link new identifier
deprecate identifier (rare)
4.3 Entity Detail
Goal: view entity truth and relationships.
Displays:
entity_id, type, lifecycle state
identifiers
related entities/actors
temporal relationship history
Actions (guarded):
add/update relationship (effective date)
4.4 Identifier Inspector
Goal: resolve the “why does this map here?” question.
Displays:
identifier type/value
current canonical mapping
history of links/unlinks
conflict flags
Actions:
propose reassignment (creates request, not direct mutation)
4.5 Relationship Graph View
Goal: visualize ownership/control networks.
Features:
adjacency visualization
filters by relationship type
time slider (effective dates)
4.6 Conflict & Quarantine Queue
Goal: manage ambiguous identifiers and collisions.
Displays:
collision cases
affected canonicals
evidence summary
Actions (governed):
approve link
reject link
open merge evaluation
4.7 Merge / Split Workbench (Governed)
Goal: safely propose and execute merge/split operations.
Merge Workbench:
select canonicals
view overlap evidence (identifiers, relationships)
choose survivor canonical
attach rationale
governance reference (optional/required)
Split Workbench:
define resulting canonicals
allocate identifiers
allocate relationships
attach rationale
4.8 Audit Timeline
Goal: show the identity story end-to-end.
Displays:
identity events (created, linked, merged, split)
decision artifacts with rationale
correlation IDs
Export:
audit pack JSON/PDF
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
GlobalSearchBar
SearchResultsTable
CanonicalHeaderCard
IdentifierList
IdentifierConflictBadge
RelationshipTable (effective dated)
RelationshipGraphPanel
EventTimeline
ConflictQueueTable
MergeWorkbench
SplitWorkbench
GovernedActionModal (actor + reason + governance_ref)
AuditPackExporter
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
Read:
search by identifier/name
resolve identifier → canonical
get actor/entity detail
list relationships (current + historical)
get event history and decisions
list conflict/quarantine items
Write (guarded):
create actor/entity
link identifier
add/update relationship
propose merge/split
execute merge/split (if permitted)
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: fast identifier resolution (hot path)
Security: RBAC on all write paths
Auditability: all actions require reason
Clarity: explicit survivor and redirect semantics for merges

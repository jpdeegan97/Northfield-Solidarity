Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the frontend (FE) / operator UI specification for DAT.
DAT is an execution engine with real external side effects; therefore the FE must be:
Control-focused (visibility, gating, intervention)
Audit-friendly (immutable timelines, evidence trails)
Safety-first (no accidental execution)
This document defines canonical screens, components, interactions, and data requirements, independent of any UI framework.
2. FE Design Principles
No Accidental Execution
No one-click destructive actions
Two-step confirmation for any control action
Kill switch always visible and protected
Version-Pinned Visibility
Every view shows plan_id + plan_version
All metrics and logs tied to the same version
Progressive Disclosure
Simple overview first
Drill down into steps, constraints, events
Explainability for Operators
Operators must see why admission was denied
Operators must see constraint and budget violations
Replay / Audit Readiness
Timeline view is immutable
Ability to export execution timeline for audit
3. Primary User Personas
Operator — monitors execution runs, intervenes on failures
Planner — drafts plans, runs staging, submits to GGP
Governance Reviewer — inspects plan package and constraints (may live in GGP UI)
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Plan Registry (List View)
Goal: Provide a searchable list of plans and their current states.
Core Elements:
Plan cards/rows:execution_plan_idplan_versionlinked insight reference (insight_id, insight_version)statuscreated_at / updated_atbudget cap + spentlast execution outcome (if any)
Key Interactions:
Filter by status (draft/approved/executing/etc.)
Filter by connector target
Open Plan Detail
4.2 Plan Detail (Plan + Constraints + Rollback)
Goal: Inspect what will be executed (or was executed) for a specific plan version.
Sections:
Summary Headerplan_id, plan_versionlinked insightstatusgovernance decision reference (if approved)
Step Graphordered stepsaction type + target systempreconditions/postconditions (if captured)
Constraint Panelhard vs softtime windowquantity caps
Budget Panelbudget capspend so farremaining
Rollback Coveragerollback type per stepcompensating actions
Submission Historyreadiness reportsubmitted timestamp
4.3 Staging / Admission View
Goal: Provide transparency into staging results and admission checks.
Sections:
Connector health status
Validation outputs
Admission decisionpass/failviolations list
Governance gate status
Key Interactions:
Request re-run of staging checks (governed)
Request admission re-check (governed)
4.4 Execution Run Detail (Timeline)
Goal: Provide a step-by-step immutable execution view.
Core Elements:
Execution timeline:step.startedstep.completedstep.failedstep.rolled_backplan.aborted/completed
Step drill-down:request/response metadata (redacted)idempotency keyretry countfailure cause classification
Key Interactions:
Expand/collapse steps
Export timeline
4.5 Kill Switch & Controls Panel
Goal: Provide safe intervention without ambiguity.
Controls (Governed):
Pause execution plane
Abort a running plan
Disable a connector (circuit breaker)
Safety Requirements:
Two-step confirmation
Require explicit reason
Emit auditable control events
5. Cross-Engine Visibility Requirements
DAT FE must surface external references:
PIE: insight reference that caused plan creation
GGP: approval decision reference
FLO: spend events (linked, not duplicated)
PTE: performance metrics references
Prefer link-outs rather than embedding external truth.
6. Component Inventory (Suggested)
PlanRow / PlanCard
StatusBadge
BudgetMeter
ConstraintBadge (Hard/Soft)
StepGraph
StepRow
RollbackBadge
AdmissionPanel
ConnectorHealthPanel
ExecutionTimeline
EventRow
ControlActionModal (confirm + reason)
KillSwitchWidget
7. Data Requirements (API Needs)
7.1 Plan Registry
Required fields:
execution_plan_id
plan_version
linked insight reference
status
created_at / updated_at
budget cap
budget spent
last_execution_outcome
7.2 Plan Detail
Required fields:
plan artifact (steps/actions)
constraint snapshot
budget snapshot
rollback policy
governance decision reference
readiness report
7.3 Execution Timeline
Required fields:
execution events stream
step states
retry metadata
rollback results
7.4 Controls
Required fields:
control endpoints (pause/abort/disable connector)
last control actions + reasons
8. Non-Functional Requirements
Audit grade: stable identifiers and immutable views
Fast search: plan registry must be responsive
Role-based safety: only approved operators can trigger controls
Redaction: connector secrets never appear
9. Document Position in DAT Corpus
This FE document is informed by:
NS-DAT-003 — ARCHITECTURE
NS-DAT-004 — LIFECYCLE
NS-DAT-007 — DATAMODEL
It complements:
NS-DAT-011 — APIMAP
NS-DAT-012 — STATE

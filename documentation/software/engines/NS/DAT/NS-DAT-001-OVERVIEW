Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT)
1. Purpose
The Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT) engine is responsible for planning, staging, and executing governed market actions derived from approved insights.
DAT exists to answer the question:
How do we turn an approved opportunity into a concrete, executable plan — safely, repeatably, and measurably?
DAT operates only on approved inputs and never invents opportunities. It translates intent into execution-ready workflows.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
DAT sits in the execution planning and orchestration layer of the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
Upstream inputs:
PIE — approved insights and opportunity context
SIM — scenario analysis, sensitivity bounds
GGP — authorization, constraints, approvals
Downstream integrations:
Marketplaces
Ad platforms
Vendors / suppliers
Automation and fulfillment systems
DAT is the bridge between strategy and action.
3. What DAT Produces
DAT produces Execution Plans, which are structured, versioned artifacts describing:
What actions will be taken
In what sequence
Under what constraints
With what budgets and risk limits
With what success and rollback criteria
Execution Plans may result in:
Dry-run simulations
Scheduled executions
Live automated actions
All outputs are governed, auditable, and replayable.
4. What DAT Does Not Do
To preserve system safety and clarity, DAT explicitly does not:
Generate opportunities or insights (PIE)
Approve actions or budgets (GGP)
Perform financial accounting (FLO)
Simulate hypothetical outcomes (SIM)
Manage identity or permissions (IDN)
DAT executes within bounds set by others.
5. Core Capabilities
Execution Planning
Translate approved insights into step-by-step plans.
Constraint Enforcement
Respect governance, budget, timing, and risk limits.
Dry-Run & Staging
Validate plans without live execution.
Execution Orchestration
Coordinate APIs, jobs, and workflows.
Rollback & Recovery
Provide safe abort and unwind mechanisms.
Telemetry Emission
Emit execution events for observability and accounting.
6. Interaction With Other Engines



Engine

Relationship to DAT


PIE

Supplies approved insights


SIM

Supplies scenario bounds


GGP

Governs authorization and constraints


FLO

Consumes execution financial events


PTE

Tracks execution performance


SIG

May receive execution-generated signals
DAT never bypasses governance or accounting.
7. Operational Posture
DAT is:
Write-heavy during execution
Stateful with explicit checkpoints
Highly controlled (kill switches, approvals)
Observable at every step
Fail-safe by design
DAT favors correctness and safety over raw speed.
8. Expected Outcomes
When DAT is operating correctly:
Approved opportunities move to execution smoothly
Risk and budget overruns are prevented
Failures are contained and reversible
Performance is measurable and attributable
DAT turns insight into impact — safely.

Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides an End-to-End Example (EEE) illustrating how the Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT) engine operates across its full lifecycle.
The goal is to:
Validate the DAT architecture and decision rules
Demonstrate governance, execution, rollback, and audit behavior
Show how DAT interacts with PIE, GGP, FLO, and PTE in practice
This example is illustrative but concrete, intended to surface edge cases and confirm system correctness.
2. Scenario Overview
Scenario:
Launch and test a limited-run digital product listing based on an approved market opportunity.
Assumptions:
Opportunity identified and approved via PIE + GGP
Budget and constraints are conservative
External marketplace supports idempotent APIs
3. Inputs
3.1 Approved Insight (From PIE)
insight_id: INS-7421
insight_version: 3
Opportunity: "Strong short-term demand for niche accessory X"
This insight has passed governance review and is approved for execution planning.
3.2 Governance Constraints (From GGP)
Max budget: $5,000 USD
Execution window: 14 days
Max inventory commitment: 100 units
Rollback required for any failed marketplace action
4. Phase 1 — Plan Drafting
DAT Plan Builder creates Execution Plan v1:
execution_plan_id: PLAN-9912
plan_version: 1
Linked to (INS-7421, v3)
Steps Defined:
Create marketplace listing
Enable paid promotion
Place supplier order
Each step includes:
Explicit action parameters
Constraint references
Rollback policy
Plan state: draft
5. Phase 2 — Governance Approval
Submission to GGP
DAT submits:
Plan v1
Budget snapshot
Constraint snapshot
Rollback coverage report
Governance Outcome
Plan approved without modification
Plan state transitions:
draft → submitted_for_approval → approved
6. Phase 3 — Staging & Dry Run
DAT performs:
Connector validation (marketplace + supplier)
Parameter validation
Dry-run API calls (no side effects)
No errors detected.
Plan state transitions:
approved → staged
7. Phase 4 — Execution Admission
At execution start time:
Admission checks performed:
Budget available: PASS
Time window valid: PASS
Kill switch: OFF
Connector health: PASS
Admission decision:
admission_allowed = true
Plan state transitions:
staged → executing
8. Phase 5 — Step Execution
Step 1 — Create Marketplace Listing
Action executed successfully
step_state: completed
Telemetry emitted: step.completed
Step 2 — Enable Paid Promotion
External API timeout occurs
step_state: failed
DAT behavior:
Emits step.failed
Evaluates rollback policy
Rollback policy:
Disable any partially created promotion
Rollback succeeds:
step_state: rolled_back
DAT decision:
Abort plan (promotion is critical path)
9. Phase 6 — Abort & Rollback
Plan transitions:
executing → aborted
DAT emits:
plan.aborted
rollback telemetry
Supplier order step is not executed due to abort.
10. Phase 7 — Post-Execution Reconciliation
DAT performs reconciliation:
Budget spent: $200 (listing fee)
Budget remaining: $4,800
Financial events emitted to FLO:
spend.incurred ($200)
PTE receives performance telemetry indicating aborted execution.
11. Phase 8 — Archival
DAT freezes artifacts:
Plan v1
Execution events
Decision artifacts
Plan state transitions:
aborted → archived
12. Replay & Audit Walkthrough
From persisted artifacts, auditors can reconstruct:
Exact plan definition (v1)
Approved constraints and budget
Step-by-step execution timeline
Failure cause and rollback behavior
Financial impact attribution
No mutable state is required.
13. Cross-Engine Traceability

14. Validation Outcomes
This EEE validates that:
DAT never executes without approval
Rollback is automatic and effective
Budget enforcement is accurate
Failures are contained
Full audit and replay are possible

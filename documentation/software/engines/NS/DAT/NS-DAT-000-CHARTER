NSDC Engine Charter — DAT (Digital Arbitrage Tooling)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Digital Arbitrage Tooling
Acronym: DAT
Engine Type: Execution / Arbitrage / Intelligence Application
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to identify arbitrage opportunities across multiple marketplaces, analyze profitability, and execute trades or actions in alignment with insights gathered from PIE and other NSDC engines.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Analyze multiple marketplaces for arbitrage opportunities
  Integrate and validate insights from PIE (Product InsightIQ Engine)
  Execute trades or purchase/sell operations across marketplaces
  Track and report executed actions and outcomes
  Log performance and maintain audit-ready execution history
  Interface with MUX for marketplace connectivity and API handling
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Govern compliance or risk policies (GGP)
  Maintain financial ledgers or accounting beyond execution tracking (FLO)
  Generate product canonical data (PIE)
  Publish content or manage engagement (CDE)
DAT is focused on arbitrage execution and monitoring only.
5. Inputs (What This Engine Consumes)

☐
6. Outputs (What This Engine Produces)
Output
Target Engine(s)
Description
Frequency
Executed orders
MUX / Marketplaces
Trades, purchases, or sales performed
Event-driven
Performance logs
Admin / GGP
Tracking of success/failure and execution metrics
Continuous
Profitability reports
Admin / FLO
ROI and efficiency of executed arbitrage actions
Scheduled
Alerts & notifications
Admin
Exceptions, errors, or arbitrage opportunities
Event-driven
7. Authority & Decision Rights
DAT May Decide Autonomously:
  Which opportunities to execute based on predefined thresholds
  Retry or cancel executions in response to errors or market changes
  Logging and reporting formats
DAT Must Not Decide:
  Governance policy enforcement (GGP)
  Financial ledger maintenance beyond execution tracking (FLO)
  Product canonicalization (PIE)
  Content publication or engagement (CDE)
8. Governance & Constraints
  Must comply with GGP-defined policies and limits
  All executions must be logged for audit and reporting
  Must use MUX interfaces for marketplace connectivity
  Execution thresholds must be predefined and auditable
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Market data discrepancies
  Execution errors due to connectivity or throttling
  Miscalculation of arbitrage profit
Worst-Case Failure:
  Losses due to failed execution or delayed action
  Missed arbitrage opportunities impacting ROI
Blast Radius:
  Primarily affects financial performance (FLO) and market operations
  Governance and audit (GGP) may be impacted if logs are incomplete
Containment strategy:
  Retry mechanisms and backoff strategies
  Alerts for failures
  Performance logging for post-incident review
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Maximizing arbitrage profit while respecting governance constraints
  Time Horizon: Near real-time to real-time execution depending on market conditions
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Marketplace APIs and credentials (MUX)
  Product and pricing data (PIE)
  Execution signals (SIG)
  Governance flags and thresholds (GGP)
  Historical execution logs for analysis
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Identification of arbitrage opportunities
  Execution of trades across at least 2 marketplaces
  Logging and reporting of executed actions
  Integration with PIE and MUX for data and connectivity
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive execution beyond defined thresholds
  Full marketplace coverage beyond MVP scope
  Governance or financial ledger creation beyond logging
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Basic identification and execution on limited marketplaces
  Phase 2: Expanded coverage, automated retries, performance logging
  Phase 3: Predictive, AI-assisted arbitrage and optimization across multiple markets
14. Engine Status

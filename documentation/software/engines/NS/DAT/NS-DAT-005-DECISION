Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision semantics used by the Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT) engine to:
Determine whether an execution plan is ready for governance submission
Gate execution at runtime via admission control
Decide when to retry, rollback, pause, or abort execution
DAT decisioning is operational, bounded, and non-authoritative. Strategic intent comes from PIE, and final approval authority resides with GGP.
2. Decision Boundary Principles
DAT decision logic is constrained by the following boundaries:
DAT may decide operationally — how execution proceeds safely and correctly
DAT may not decide strategically — whether an opportunity should be pursued
DAT may not approve execution — GGP is the sole approval authority
All decisions must be explainable — every decision must be attributable to explicit inputs
DAT answers:
Is this plan complete enough to submit to governance?
Is it safe to execute this plan right now?
How should execution respond to failure or constraint violation?
3. Decision Objects
3.1 Plan Readiness Decision
Definition
A structured assessment indicating whether a draft Execution Plan is complete and internally consistent for governance submission.
Outputs
ready_for_approval (true / false)
readiness_reasons (structured, machine-readable)
3.2 Execution Admission Decision
Definition
A runtime decision made immediately prior to execution start.
Outputs
admission_allowed (true / false)
violations (list of failed checks)
3.3 Step Continuation Decision
Definition
A per-step decision evaluated after each step finishes.
Possible Outcomes
continue
retry
rollback
abort
3.4 Rollback Activation Decision
Definition
A decision to initiate rollback policies due to failure, constraint violation, or manual intervention.
Rollback activation must always be explicit and logged.
4. Decision Inputs
DAT decision logic may consider:
Plan structure validity (steps, actions, ordering)
Constraint definitions (hard vs soft)
Budget availability and burn rate
Connector health and circuit breaker state
External system responses
Governance approval state (from GGP)
Time window and scheduling constraints
Kill-switch state
All inputs must be explicit, versioned, and logged.
5. Decision Rules
5.1 Plan Readiness Rules (Pre-Governance)
A plan is ready for governance submission only if all conditions are met:
Insight PinningPlan references (insight_id, insight_version)
Complete Step GraphSteps are orderedNo missing stepsEach step contains exactly one Action
Constraint CompletenessBudget constraint presentTime window constraint present (if applicable)Risk constraints defined where required
Rollback CoverageEvery step has a rollback or compensating action
Connector EligibilityAll referenced connectors exist and are enabled
If any rule fails:
ready_for_approval = false
Failure reasons returned
5.2 Execution Admission Rules (Pre-Execution)
Execution admission is allowed only if:
Plan state = approved AND staged
All hard constraints pass
Budget is available
Required connectors are healthy
Global kill switch is not active
If admission fails:
Execution does not start
Plan remains in staged state
Violation events are emitted
5.3 Runtime Constraint Violation Rules
If a hard constraint is violated during execution:
Pause execution immediately
Initiate rollback
Abort plan if rollback completes or is impossible
If a soft constraint is violated:
Continue execution
Emit warning events
Flag for operator/governance review
5.4 Retry Rules (Per Step)
Retries are allowed only if:
Step is idempotent or
Connector supports idempotency keys
Retry count < configured maximum
Constraints still pass
Retry behavior:
Must reuse idempotency keys
Must emit retry events
Must be bounded
5.5 Abort Rules
Abort may be triggered by:
Manual kill switch
Unrecoverable connector failure
Persistent hard constraint violations
Budget exhaustion
Abort behavior:
Emit abort event
Transition plan to aborted
Invoke rollback policies if configured
6. Decision Outputs & Artifacts
DAT decisioning produces append-only artifacts:
plan_readiness_report
execution_admission_record
step_decision_record
rollback_activation_record
These artifacts are required for audit, replay, and governance review.
7. Governance Handoff Semantics
When submitting to GGP, DAT provides:
Plan version
Constraint snapshot
Budget snapshot
Rollback coverage report
Plan readiness report
GGP returns:
Approval or rejection
Constraint/budget modifications (if required)
DAT stores governance decision references and never executes outside approved scope.
8. Invariants & Safety Constraints
No execution without GGP approval
Admission control cannot be bypassed
All retries are bounded and idempotent
Hard constraint violations trigger rollback or abort
Every decision is logged and explainable

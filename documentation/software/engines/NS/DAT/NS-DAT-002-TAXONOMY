Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Digital Arbitrage Tooling (DAT) engine.
The taxonomy establishes the atomic execution primitives used to:
Translate approved opportunities into executable plans
Enforce governance, budget, and risk constraints
Ensure execution is auditable, replayable, and reversible
This taxonomy is the shared language across DAT, GGP, FLO, SIM, and PTE.
2. Taxonomy Design Principles
Execution Is Explicit — No implicit or hidden actions
Plans Before Actions — Nothing executes without a plan
Constraints Are First-Class — Execution is bounded by design
Rollback Is Mandatory — Every action must define recovery
Telemetry Is Canonical — Every action emits measurable events
3. Core DAT Primitives
3.1 Execution Plan
Definition:
A versioned, governed artifact describing how an approved opportunity will be executed.
Characteristics:
Derived from a specific PIE Insight version
Authorized by GGP
Bound by explicit constraints
Key Attributes:
execution_plan_id
plan_version
linked_insight_id
linked_insight_version
status (draft / approved / staged / executing / completed / aborted)
3.2 Action
Definition:
An atomic, externally visible operation performed against a system or market.
Examples:
Create marketplace listing
Launch ad campaign
Place supplier order
Update pricing
Key Attributes:
action_id
action_type
target_system
parameters
Actions are never executed directly; they belong to Steps.
3.3 Step
Definition:
A single ordered unit of execution within a plan.
Characteristics:
Executes exactly one Action
Has explicit preconditions and postconditions
Key Attributes:
step_id
execution_plan_id
step_order
action_id
step_status (pending / running / completed / failed / rolled_back)
3.4 Constraint
Definition:
A rule that limits or bounds execution.
Types:
Budget constraint
Time window constraint
Risk threshold
Quantity cap
Key Attributes:
constraint_id
constraint_type
constraint_parameters
enforcement_level (hard / soft)
3.5 Budget
Definition:
A quantified financial limit applied to a plan or step.
Characteristics:
Enforced pre-execution and during execution
Reported to FLO
Key Attributes:
budget_id
currency
max_amount
spent_amount
3.6 Rollback Policy
Definition:
A predefined recovery strategy if execution deviates from expectations.
Types:
Automatic rollback
Manual rollback
Compensating action
Key Attributes:
rollback_policy_id
rollback_type
rollback_steps
3.7 Execution Context
Definition:
The immutable snapshot of state and parameters under which execution occurs.
Includes:
Plan version
Constraint snapshot
Budget snapshot
External system states (if captured)
Execution Context is stored for replay and audit.
4. Telemetry & Event Primitives
4.1 Execution Event
Definition:
An immutable record emitted during execution.
Examples:
step.started
step.completed
step.failed
plan.aborted
Key Attributes:
event_id
execution_plan_id
step_id (optional)
event_type
timestamp
correlation_id
4.2 Financial Event
Definition:
A monetary-impacting event emitted to FLO.
Examples:
spend.incurred
refund.issued
These events are authoritative for accounting.
5. Execution States
5.1 Plan States
draft
approved
staged
executing
completed
aborted
State transitions are governed and append-only.
5.2 Step States
pending
running
completed
failed
rolled_back
Steps cannot be skipped or reordered once execution begins.
6. Relationships Between Primitives
Execution Plan → many Steps
Step → one Action
Execution Plan → many Constraints
Execution Plan → one Budget
Step → optional Rollback Policy
Execution Plan → many Execution Events
7. Cross-Engine Alignment



Engine

Interaction


PIE

Supplies approved Insight versions


SIM

Supplies execution bounds and sensitivities


GGP

Authorizes plans and constraints


FLO

Consumes financial events


PTE

Tracks performance metrics
DAT primitives map cleanly into governance and accounting systems.
8. Invariants & Safety Rules
No Action executes outside a Step
No Step executes outside an approved Plan
No Plan executes without constraints and rollback policy
All execution emits telemetry
All financial impact is reported
9. Document Position in DAT Corpus

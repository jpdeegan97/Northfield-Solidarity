NSDC Engine Charter — SIG (Signal Aggregation Engine)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Signal Aggregation Engine
Acronym: SIG
Engine Type: Intelligence / Signal Processing
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to collect, aggregate, and process multiple external and internal signals—including market trends, social, sentiment, and alternative data sources—to provide actionable signals for NSDC decision-making.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Aggregate signals from diverse sources: marketplaces, news, social media, APIs, and internal engines
  Normalize and structure signals for consumption
  Filter, rank, and prioritize signals based on relevance and reliability
  Feed actionable signals to execution engines (DAT) and intelligence engines (PIE)
  Maintain historical signal archives for backtesting and analysis
  Provide alerts for significant or emergent events
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Directly execute trades or arbitrage (DAT)
  Govern capital or risk policies (GGP)
  Create product intelligence or canonical product records (PIE)
  Distribute content or manage engagement (CDE)
  Maintain financial ledgers (FLO)
SIG is purely a signal collection and processing engine.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
SIG May Decide Autonomously:
  How to normalize, rank, and prioritize signals
  Signal relevance scoring and filtering
  Alert thresholds for emergent events
SIG Must Not Decide:
  When to execute trades or deploy capital
  Governance policy enforcement
  Product development or content strategies
SIG informs decision-making; it does not act directly.
8. Governance & Constraints
  Signal collection and processing must comply with GGP policies
  Maintain audit-ready logs for all signal ingestion and processing
  Data integrity and accuracy checks must be enforced
  Alerts must adhere to governance-defined escalation paths
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Signal feed interruption or errors
  Misclassification or misranking of signals
  Latency in processing
Worst-Case Failure:
  Downstream engines act on incorrect or incomplete signals
  Missed opportunities due to delayed signals
Blast Radius:
  Primarily impacts DAT execution and PIE insights
  No direct financial or compliance violation
Containment strategy:
  Signal validation and redundancy
  Alerting on anomalies
  Historical signal backup for recovery
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Signal accuracy, relevance, and timeliness
  Time Horizon: Real-time for emergent events, near real-time for general trends
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Canonical entity IDs (IDN)
  Product IDs and attributes (PIE)
  Market identifiers and API endpoints (MUX)
  Execution references (DAT)
  Governance flags (GGP)
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Aggregation from 2–3 primary signal sources
  Normalization and relevance scoring
  Alerts for emergent events
  Logging and historical archiving
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive modeling for signals beyond relevance scoring
  Integration with all possible signal sources beyond MVP
  Execution of trades or direct actions
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Signal aggregation, normalization, and ranking
  Phase 2: Multi-source integration with advanced prioritization and scoring
  Phase 3: Predictive signal modeling and automated recommendation for execution engines
14. Engine Status
☑ Concept
☐ Defined
☐ Approved
☐ MVP
☐ Production
☐ Deprecated

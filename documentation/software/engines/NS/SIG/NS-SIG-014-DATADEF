Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical data contracts and field-level definitions for the Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG).
It complements NS-SIG-007 — DATAMODEL by:
providing semantic definitions for every field
specifying invariants and constraints
clarifying cross-engine expectations
acting as the definitive reference for consumers (PIE, SIM, DAT, FLO, DRE, GGP)
2. Data Definition Principles
Semantic Stability — field meanings never change
Immutability by Default — authoritative records are append-only
Explainability — scores and decisions must be interpretable
Minimalism — only essential data is exposed downstream
ID-First Contracts — cross-engine references use IDs, not payload copying
3. Canonical Signal Contract
3.1 signal
Represents an atomic observation.
Field
Type
Definition
signal_id
UUID
Globally unique identifier for the signal
signal_type
String
Canonical signal name (taxonomy-defined)
signal_class
Enum
market, demand, supply, execution, financial, system
source_system
String
Originating system identifier
observed_at
Timestamp (UTC)
When the observation occurred externally
received_at
Timestamp (UTC)
When SIG ingested the signal
value
JSON
Normalized observation payload
unit
String
Unit of measure (if applicable)
trust_score
Decimal (0–1)
Reliability of the source and integrity
confidence_score
Decimal (0–1)
Completeness and measurement quality
decay_model
String

decay_params
JSON
Parameters (half-life, TTL)
normalization_ruleset
String
Normalization ruleset name

Persistence time
Invariants:
signal_id is immutable
value meaning never changes
scores are explicit, never inferred
4. Raw Capture Contract
4.1 signal_raw_capture
Preserves raw inputs for replay and audit.

5. Provenance Contract
5.1 signal_provenance
Links signals to upstream sources.
Field
Type
Definition
signal_id
UUID
Canonical signal
source_type
Enum
mux, telemetry, vendor
source_ref
String
artifact_id or event_id
6. Deduplication Contract
6.1 signal_dedupe_ref
Represents duplicate linkage.
Field
Type
Definition
dedupe_id
UUID
Deduplication reference
signal_id
UUID
Canonical signal
dedupe_key
String
Stable dedupe key
linked_at
Timestamp
Link time
7. Decision Artifact Contract

correlation_key
String
Shared grouping key
signal_ids
Array<UUID>

9. Cross-Engine Contract Expectations
Engine
Usage Constraints
PIE
Must respect trust/confidence; no re-scoring
SIM
May recompute scenarios but not signals
DAT
Emits execution telemetry only
FLO
Financial signals are non-authoritative
DRE
Exploratory reads only
GGP
Audit and governance only
10. Field-Level Constraints & Validation
All timestamps UTC
Scores bounded [0,1]
JSON payloads schema-validated
IDs globally unique
11. Backward Compatibility Rules
Fields may be added, not removed
Field meaning must never change
Deprecated fields remain readable
12. Document Position in SIG Corpus
This DATADEF complements:
NS-SIG-007 — DATAMODEL
NS-SIG-006 — VERSION
It completes the SIG documentation set.

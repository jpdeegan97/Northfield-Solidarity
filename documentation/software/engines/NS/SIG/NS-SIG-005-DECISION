Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework used by the Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG).
SIG decisions are local, deterministic, and non-authoritative. They exist to:
determine admissibility of inputs
assign trust and confidence scores
control deduplication and linkage
govern replay, backfill, and reprocessing
SIG decisions do not approve actions, rank opportunities, or assert strategy.
2. Decision Design Principles
Determinism — identical inputs + ruleset versions yield identical outcomes
Explainability — every decision produces a rationale artifact
Locality — decisions apply only to signal processing, not downstream meaning
Append-Only — decisions are recorded; originals are never mutated
Governed Overrides — only specific decisions may be overridden, and only with audit
3. Decision Classes
SIG defines five primary decision classes:
Source Admission Decisions
Normalization Decisions
Trust & Confidence Scoring Decisions
Deduplication Decisions
Operational Control Decisions
Each class emits a decision artifact.
4. Source Admission Decisions
Question Answered:
Should this source/input be admitted for signal processing?
Inputs:
source_system
ingestion method
schema compatibility
governance flags
Outcomes:
admit
quarantine
reject
Notes:
Admission rules are versioned
High-risk sources may require governance reference
5. Normalization Decisions
Question Answered:
Can this input be mapped to a canonical signal type?
Inputs:
raw payload
normalization ruleset version
Outcomes:
normalized (signal_type assigned)
quarantined (schema_unknown)
Notes:
Normalization failures never mutate inputs
Schema drift emits system signals
6. Trust & Confidence Scoring Decisions
Question Answered:
How reliable and complete is this signal?
Inputs:
source reliability profile
integrity metadata
latency and completeness
scoring ruleset version
Outputs:
trust_score (0–1)
confidence_score (0–1)
Notes:
Scores are numeric and explainable
Thresholds may be governed but never implicit
7. Deduplication Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this a new signal or a duplicate observation?
Inputs:
stable dedupe keys
hashes
temporal proximity
Outcomes:
accept_new
link_existing
Notes:
No destructive merges
Linkage preserves all provenance
8. Operational Control Decisions
Question Answered:
Should ingestion, replay, or reprocessing occur?
Decision Types:
pause source ingestion
resume source ingestion
trigger replay
trigger backfill
trigger reprocess
Requirements:
actor identity
reason
governance reference (when required)
9. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each SIG decision emits an immutable artifact with:
decision_id (UUID)
decision_type
subject_ref (signal_id, source, or job)
outcome
rationale (structured)
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
actor_id (if applicable)
evaluated_at
correlation_id
Decision artifacts are queryable and auditable.
10. Decision Boundaries
SIG decisions:
affect signal lifecycle only
never propagate intent
never imply correctness of strategy
Downstream engines (PIE, SIM, DAT, GGP) make higher-order decisions.
11. Failure Modes & Safeguards
If a decision engine fails → quarantine input
If scoring fails → default to lowest trust + flag
If dedupe ambiguous → accept_new with linkage hint
Safety favors preservation over suppression.
12. Cross-Engine Interaction
Engine
Interaction
MUX
Supplies raw external observations
PIE
Consumes trust/confidence-scored signals
GGP
Audits decisions and overrides

Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the optional frontend (FE) / operator UI for the Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG).
The SIG operator UI is designed to:
provide visibility into signal ingestion and health
surface trust, confidence, and decay behavior
allow governed operational controls (replay, rebuild, source tuning)
support audit and explainability for downstream decisions
SIG FE is observational first, control second.
2. FE Design Principles
Signals Are Immutable — UI never edits signal facts
Trust Is Visible — scores and rationale are always shown
Derived ≠ Authoritative — aggregates are labeled clearly
Governed Controls — operational actions require identity and reason
Traceability — lineage is one click away
3. Primary Personas
Signal Operator — monitors ingestion and health
Data Steward — investigates anomalies and schema drift
Research / Strategy — explores signal landscapes
Auditor — inspects provenance and decisions
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Signal Health Dashboard
Goal: System-wide health snapshot.
Displays:
ingestion rate by source
backlog/lag per source
normalization error rate
scoring anomalies
dedupe rate
4.2 Source Detail View
Goal: Deep visibility into a single source.
Sections:
source reliability profile
recent signals
trust/confidence distributions
schema drift events
Actions (Governed):
pause/resume ingestion
adjust reliability weight
4.3 Signal Explorer
Goal: Search and inspect canonical signals.
Filters:
signal_class
signal_type
source_system
trust_score range
observed_at range
Results:
signal_id
value
scores
decay model
4.4 Signal Detail (Explainability View)
Goal: Full explainability for a single signal.
Sections:
normalized signal payload
trust & confidence rationale
decay parameters
provenance links (MUX artifacts, telemetry)
decision artifacts
4.5 Aggregate Explorer
Goal: Inspect derived aggregates.
Views:
windowed aggregates
weighted aggregates
Clearly labeled as derived.
4.6 Correlation Group Viewer
Goal: Inspect signal correlation groups.
Displays:
correlation key
member signals
time span
No causal claims shown.
4.7 Replay & Rebuild Console (Governed)
Goal: Trigger and monitor operational jobs.
Job Types:
replay canonical signals
rebuild aggregates
rebuild correlations
Required:
actor identity
reason
governance reference (if required)
4.8 Anomaly & Drift Inbox
Goal: Surface system and data quality issues.
Items:
schema drift detected
missing data windows
abnormal trust-score shifts
Actions:
acknowledge
investigate
trigger reprocess
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
SignalHealthPanel
SourceReliabilityCard
SignalTable
SignalDetailPanel
ProvenanceGraph
AggregateTable
CorrelationGroupViewer
ReplayJobWizard
JobStatusTable
GovernedActionModal
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
list signals (filtered)
get signal detail + lineage
list aggregates
list correlation groups
list source health
create replay/rebuild job
list job status
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: fast filtering over large signal sets
Security: RBAC on sensitive provenance views
Auditability: log all operator actions
Clarity: derived vs authoritative always explicit
8. Document Position in SIG Corpus

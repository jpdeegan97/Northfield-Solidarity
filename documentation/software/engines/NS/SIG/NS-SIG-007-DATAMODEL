Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the authoritative data model for the Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG).
It specifies:
Canonical signal entities and schemas
Immutable storage rules
Derived aggregate and correlation structures
Decision and provenance linkage
Cross-engine data contracts
This document is the single source of truth for how signals are persisted and referenced.
2. Data Model Principles
Signals Are Immutable — once written, never edited or deleted
Append-Only Processing — new facts create new rows
Explicit Provenance — every signal links to its source artifacts
Derived ≠ Authoritative — aggregates are rebuildable
Version-Bound Semantics — ruleset versions always recorded
3. Persistence Layers
3.1 Raw Signal Capture Store (Optional)
Used for replay and forensics.
3.2 Canonical Signal Store (Authoritative)
Stores normalized, trust-scored signals.
3.3 Derived Stores (Rebuildable)
Stores aggregates, correlation groups, and indices.
4. Canonical Entity Definitions
4.1 Canonical Signal (signal)
Meaning: Atomic, time-bound observation.

6. Relationships (Logical)
signal_raw_capture → signal (N:1)
signal → signal_provenance (1:N)
signal → signal_dedupe_ref (1:N)
signal → signal_decision (1:N)
signal → signal_aggregate (N:M via logic)
signal → signal_correlation_group (N:M)
7. Cross-Engine Data Contracts
Engine
References
PIE
signal_id, signal_type, scores
SIM
signal_id, aggregates
DAT
execution signal_id
FLO
financial signal_id
GGP
signal_decision
Signals are referenced by ID only.
8. Invariants & Constraints
signal rows are immutable
derived tables are disposable
every signal has at least one provenance link
all decisions are recorded

Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose
The Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG) is responsible for ingesting, normalizing, scoring, and aggregating raw signals from across the internal and external landscape.
SIG answers a single foundational question:
What signals exist right now, how reliable are they, and how do they relate to one another?
SIG does not decide strategy, generate insights, execute actions, or govern outcomes. It exists to provide clean, trust-scored signal primitives that higher-order engines can reason over.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
SIG sits at the base of the intelligence stack, upstream of synthesis engines.
Primary upstream sources:
MUX — external platform events and state artifacts
Internal telemetry — execution traces, performance metrics, system events
Third-party data feeds — market, pricing, sentiment, macro indicators
Primary downstream consumers:
PIE — signal synthesis into product insights
DRE — long-horizon research and thematic discovery
SIM — scenario inputs and parameterization
GGP — audit, provenance, and governance review
SIG is the only engine permitted to define canonical signal semantics.
3. What SIG Produces
SIG produces Signals, which are atomic, time-bound observations with explicit provenance and trust metadata.
Each signal includes:
A canonical signal type
Normalized value(s)
Source attribution
Trust and confidence scores
Temporal validity and decay semantics
Signals are designed to be:
composable
comparable
replayable
explainable
4. What SIG Does Not Do
SIG explicitly does not:
Interpret signals into opportunities (PIE)
Simulate outcomes or counterfactuals (SIM)
Execute or verify actions (DAT)
Manage identities or permissions (IDN / PECA)
Approve or govern decisions (GGP)
SIG aggregates truth; others interpret it.
5. Core Capabilities
Signal Ingestion
Consume raw events and metrics from MUX and internal systems.
Normalization
Convert heterogeneous inputs into canonical signal types.
Trust Scoring
Assign reliability and confidence scores based on source, recency, and integrity.
Aggregation & Correlation
Group related signals across sources and time.
Decay & Relevance Management
Reduce influence of stale or low-confidence signals.
6. Signal Characteristics
Signals managed by SIG are:
Atomic — smallest meaningful observation
Time-indexed — bound to a moment or interval
Source-attributed — always traceable
Non-authoritative — inputs to decision-making, not decisions themselves
Signals may be contradictory; SIG preserves disagreement rather than resolving it.
7. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to SIG
MUX
Supplies raw external events
PIE
Consumes trust-scored signals
DRE
Explores long-horizon signal patterns
SIM
Uses signals as scenario inputs
DAT
May emit execution telemetry signals
GGP
Audits signal lineage and usage
SIG never bypasses governance or execution controls.
8. Operational Posture
SIG is:
Write-heavy (continuous ingestion)
Append-only for signal facts
Replayable for model evolution
Eventually consistent for derived aggregates
SIG favors completeness and traceability over immediacy.
9. Expected Outcomes
When SIG is operating correctly:
Signals are clean, comparable, and trustworthy
Noise is reduced without discarding information
Downstream engines reason with better primitives
Audit and replay are straightforward
SIG reduces ambiguity at the signal layer.

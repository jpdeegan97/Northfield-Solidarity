Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical signal taxonomy for the Signal Aggregation Engine (SIG).
The taxonomy establishes:
What constitutes a signal
How signals are categorized and normalized
Which attributes are mandatory for trust, provenance, and replay
This taxonomy prevents downstream engines from inventing incompatible or ambiguous signal semantics.
2. Taxonomy Principles
Atomicity
A signal represents the smallest meaningful observation.
Non-Interpretive
Signals describe observations, not conclusions.
Source-Explicit
Every signal must identify where it came from.
Trust-Scored
Every signal carries explicit confidence and reliability metadata.
Time-Bound
Signals decay; relevance is never assumed to be permanent.
3. Primary Signal Classes
SIG recognizes six primary classes of signals:
Market Signals
Demand Signals
Supply Signals
Execution Signals
Financial Signals
Meta & System Signals
Each class contains multiple canonical signal types.
4. Market Signals
Meaning:
Observations about market conditions, pricing, and competition.
Examples:
competitor_price_observed
listing_rank_position
ad_impression_volume
keyword_trend_velocity
Canonical Attributes:
observed_value
unit
market_scope
5. Demand Signals
Meaning:
Observations indicating customer interest or intent.
Examples:
search_volume
click_through_rate
add_to_cart_rate
conversion_event
Canonical Attributes:
count or rate
channel
audience_segment
6. Supply Signals
Meaning:
Observations about availability, inventory, or production capacity.
Examples:
inventory_level
stockout_event
supplier_lead_time
fulfillment_capacity
Canonical Attributes:
quantity
location
constraint_type
7. Execution Signals
Meaning:
Observations about internal or external execution outcomes.
Examples:
ad_campaign_started
fulfillment_completed
execution_error
latency_spike
Canonical Attributes:
execution_ref
outcome_status
latency_ms
8. Financial Signals
Meaning:
Observations related to monetary movement or exposure.
Examples:
spend_incurred
revenue_realized
refund_issued
fee_applied
Canonical Attributes:
amount
currency
direction
Note: Financial signals are non-authoritative and later reconciled by FLO.
9. Meta & System Signals
Meaning:
Signals about system behavior, trust, or data quality.
Examples:
source_reliability_score
signal_latency
data_gap_detected
schema_drift_detected
Used primarily for governance and model hygiene.
10. Cross-Cutting Signal Dimensions
All signals must include:
signal_id (UUID)
signal_type (canonical)
signal_class (one of the six)
source_system
observed_at
received_at
trust_score (0–1)
confidence_score (0–1)
decay_model
correlation_hints
raw_refs (links to MUX artifacts or internal telemetry)
11. Aggregation Primitives
SIG supports aggregation over signals:
time-window aggregation
source-weighted aggregation
confidence-weighted aggregation
correlation grouping
Aggregations produce derived signals, not authoritative facts.
12. Signal Lifecycle States (Logical)
Signals are immutable but may be logically classified as:
fresh
decaying
stale
These are computed, not stored.
13. Cross-Engine Consumption Mapping
Signal Class
Primary Consumers
Market
PIE, DRE
Demand
PIE, SIM
Supply
PIE, DAT
Execution
DAT, GGP
Financial
FLO, PIE
Meta/System
GGP, Ops
14. What This Taxonomy Enables
Clean signal synthesis in PIE
Explainable insight generation
Replayable model evolution
Governance-grade auditability

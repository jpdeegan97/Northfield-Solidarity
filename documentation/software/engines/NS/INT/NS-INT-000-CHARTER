NS-INT-000 — CHARTER

1. Identity

Project / Engine Name: Intervention

Nickname: quickscope

Domain: System-wide state, context, and real-time coherence layer for Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Owner Engine Class: Core platform engine (first-class NS engine)

Primary Consumers: GGP, Firmament, all NS engines, operator UIs, observability tooling

2. Mission

Intervention exists to provide a single, authoritative, replayable, real-time state context for the entire NS ecosystem—so every engine and UI can reliably answer:

What is true now?

How did it become true?

Who/what changed it?

What is the current process state of long-running work?

Intervention turns NS into a coherent, stateful “beast” with shared context, causal chains, and durable memory.

3. Problem Statement

As NS grows into many engines (SIG, DAT, PIE, SIM, IDN, FLO, MUX, CWP, Firmament, etc.), state tends to fragment:

Each engine invents its own lifecycle semantics

UIs reconcile “truth” inconsistently

Cross-engine workflows lose correlation and causal provenance

Debugging becomes archaeology

Governance evidence becomes scattered

Without a unified state fabric, NS cannot scale reliably, explainably, or in real time.

4. Scope

4.1 In Scope (What Intervention is)

Intervention is the State Fabric + Context Plane for NS. It provides:

Immutable Event Log (System Memory)

Append-only record of state changes across engines

Idempotent ingest and deduplication guarantees

Schema/version evolution controls

Materialized State Views (System Present)

Queryable “current state” projections derived from events

Domain-agnostic canonical projections (e.g., entity status, workflow status, request status)

Engine-specific projections when needed, using standard projector patterns

Time Travel, Replay, and Reconstruction (System Forensics)

Rebuild any view at time T

Replay event streams into sandboxes / simulators

Support audits, debugging, and retrospective governance

Real-Time Deltas and Subscriptions (System Nervous System)

Stream deltas to Firmament and operator surfaces

Topic routing by entity, engine, workflow, and correlation IDs

Backpressure-aware fanout and resumable subscriptions

Cross-Engine Correlation and Causality (System Threading)

Correlation IDs unify multi-engine work

Causation IDs link “what triggered what”

Traceable actor identity for human/agent/system actions

Edge State Caches (Local Coherence)

Lightweight local cache clients (sidecars/SDK) for engines and UIs

Low-latency reads and offline-tolerant behavior

Standard sync/resync and conflict-handling protocol

4.2 Out of Scope (What Intervention is not)

Not a governance authority: It does not decide what is allowed (GGP does).

Not a monolithic OLTP replacement: It does not replace domain databases.

Not a data lake / analytics warehouse: It is for state coherence, not BI.

Not “just UI state”: Frontend local state remains a separate concern.

5. Principles

Event-first truth: state is derived from events, not edited in place.

Explainability by default: every state change has provenance.

Replayability: any state can be reconstructed.

Contractual interoperability: engines integrate via a canonical envelope.

Governance-gated transitions: protected state transitions consult GGP.

Edge-first performance: reads should be fast where work happens.

6. Success Criteria

Intervention is successful when:

Firmament can render global NS state in real time (snapshot + deltas)

Any operator can answer “why is this stuck?” with causal chain + evidence

Cross-engine workflows have a single correlated thread end-to-end

Audits can reconstruct the exact state at any time

Engines integrate without inventing bespoke state conventions

7. Core Interfaces (Charter-Level)

7.1 Canonical Event Envelope (Minimum Contract)

All NS engines emit events using a canonical envelope:

event_id

event_type

engine_id

entity_id (or aggregate_id)

occurred_at (when it happened)

observed_at (when received)

correlation_id (thread)

causation_id (trigger)

actor (human/agent/system)

schema_version

policy_context_ref (governance context pointer)

payload (domain-specific)

7.2 Subscription Channels (High-Level)

Intervention exposes stream subscriptions keyed by:

engine

entity / aggregate

workflow instance

correlation_id

event_type

8. Governance Relationship to GGP

Intervention enforces structural validity (schema, versioning, idempotency).

GGP enforces semantic legitimacy (policy, approvals, permissioned transitions).

Intervention consults GGP for protected transitions (configurable event types).

9. Risks and Mitigations

Scope creep into “do everything data platform” → hard boundaries + projection patterns.

Event schema chaos → canonical envelope + schema registry + version gates.

Hot partitions / fanout overload → partitioning strategy + backpressure + edge caches.

Governance bottlenecks → asynchronous gating options with clear state semantics.

10. Roadmap (Charter-Level)

Phase 0 — Contract + Spine

Canonical envelope, schema/versioning rules

Ingest + immutable log

Basic projector framework

Phase 1 — Read Models + Firmament Integration

Snapshot API + delta streams

Firmament state channels

Edge cache client for UI

Phase 2 — Workflow State + Correlation

Workflow instance state model

Correlation/causation query and visualization hooks

Phase 3 — Advanced “quickscope” Extensions

Time-travel UX primitives

Replay-to-sandbox pipelines

Predictive state hints (optional)

11. Definition of Done (for Engine Acceptance)

Intervention is “live” when:

At least 3 NS engines publish canonical envelope events

Snapshot + delta stream works for Firmament

Correlation threading works end-to-end for a representative workflow

GGP gating for at least one protected transition class is operational

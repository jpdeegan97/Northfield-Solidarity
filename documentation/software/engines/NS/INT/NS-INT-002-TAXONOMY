NS-INT-002 — TAXONOMY

1. Purpose

This taxonomy defines the canonical vocabulary and classification system for Intervention (quickscope). It standardizes how NS describes:

events and state

identities and actors

workflows and gates

projections and read models

subscriptions and streams

edge caches and synchronization

The goal is to make Intervention integrations consistent across every NS engine and UI.

2. Primary Taxonomy Axes

2.1 State Primitives

Event

An immutable record describing a state transition or observation.

State

The authoritative “current truth,” derived from events.

Snapshot

A point-in-time materialization of a state view.

Delta

A streamed change representation emitted when state updates.

Projection

Deterministic transformation of events into a read model.

Read Model

Query-optimized representation of state (the “now” view).

Timeline

Ordered sequence of events for an entity, workflow, or correlation thread.

2.2 Identity and Referencing

Engine ID (engine_id)

Canonical identifier of the producing engine (e.g., GGP, FLO, MUX).

Entity / Aggregate ID (entity_id / aggregate_id)

The object whose state is changing (entity-centric or aggregate-root model).

Workflow Instance ID (workflow_id)

Identifier for a long-running process instance.

Correlation ID (correlation_id)

End-to-end thread identifier spanning engines and services.

Causation ID (causation_id)

Direct trigger pointer for “what caused this event.”

Policy Context Reference (policy_context_ref)

Pointer to governance context (policy set, decision, approval artifact) used by GGP.

Evidence Reference (evidence_ref)

Pointer to supporting evidence/artifacts (logs, docs, signatures, approvals).

2.3 Actor Model

Actor

The initiator of an event or decision.

Actor Types:

Human: operator, administrator, reviewer

Agent: autonomous or semi-autonomous worker (e.g., CWP agents)

System: automated service, scheduler, integration

Actor Fields (canonical):

actor_type (Human | Agent | System)

actor_id (stable identifier)

actor_role (optional)

actor_org (optional)

auth_context_ref (optional pointer to IDN/GGP authz artifacts)

3. Event Taxonomy

3.1 Event Categories (by semantic intent)

Domain Events

Represent meaningful domain state transitions (e.g., order_placed, invoice_posted).

Workflow Events

Represent process progression (e.g., step_started, gate_passed, timer_fired).

Governance Events

Represent policy/approval outcomes (e.g., policy_checked, approval_granted, approval_denied).

Operational Events

Represent system operations (e.g., projection_rebuilt, stream_resumed).

Observational Events

Represent detected facts/measurements (e.g., signal_detected, metric_threshold_crossed).

Error/Exception Events

Represent failures and incident state (e.g., execution_failed, compensation_required).

3.2 Event Criticality

Critical: must be persisted and projected immediately; may require governance gating

Important: persisted; projected within SLA

Informational: persisted; projection optional

Debug: optionally persisted; used for diagnostics

3.3 Event Validity Classes

Accepted: structurally valid and stored

Authoritative: accepted + eligible for projection as truth

Rejected: invalid schema/contract or policy violation

Quarantined: accepted but awaiting review/gating

4. State Object Taxonomy

4.1 Canonical State Objects

EntityState

Current state summary for an entity/aggregate.

WorkflowState

State summary for a workflow instance.

DecisionState

Governance decision snapshot (often referenced from GGP).

ExecutionState

Status of an execution run (job/task/operation).

IntegrationState

Status of an external integration handshake (MUX, connectors, APIs).

IncidentState

Status of an exception/incident and mitigation lifecycle.

4.2 Universal State Fields (recommended)

status (enum)

phase (optional sub-status)

version (monotonic)

last_event_id

last_updated_at

owner_engine_id

correlation_id (if applicable)

tags (key/value)

5. Workflow Taxonomy

5.1 Workflow Composition

Workflow Definition

Template describing steps, gates, timers, retries.

Workflow Instance

Live execution of a workflow definition.

Step

Unit of progress (work stage).

Gate

A control point that must be satisfied to proceed.

Gate Types:

Policy Gate (GGP evaluation required)

Approval Gate (human/agent approval required)

Data Gate (data availability/quality required)

Time Gate (timer / schedule)

Risk Gate (threshold/score)

Integration Gate (external confirmation)

Timer

SLA, delay, escalation, retry backoff.

Compensation

Undo/repair actions when a workflow fails midstream.

5.2 Workflow Status (canonical)

created

running

blocked

waiting_approval

waiting_data

retrying

compensating

completed

failed

cancelled

6. Projection and Read Model Taxonomy

6.1 Projection Types

Canonical Projections (Intervention-maintained, engine-agnostic)

Domain Projections (engine-maintained, but hosted/registered in Intervention)

UI Projections (optimized for rendering, e.g., Firmament surfaces)

6.2 Projection Modes

Streaming: update continuously as events arrive

Batch: rebuild on schedule or by trigger

Hybrid: streaming + periodic reconciliation

6.3 Read Model Classes

Entity View: one entity’s current state

Collection View: lists/feeds (e.g., “active workflows”)

Thread View: correlation-centric story (“what happened?”)

Graph View: linked nodes/edges for visualization

7. Subscription Taxonomy

7.1 Subscription Targets

By engine_id

By entity_id

By workflow_id

By correlation_id

By event_type

By tag query (e.g., env=prod, priority=critical)

7.2 Delivery Semantics

At-least-once (default)

Exactly-once (aspirational; usually via idempotency + version checks)

Ordered-per-key (ordered per entity/workflow/correlation key)

7.3 Stream Forms

Delta Stream: incremental changes

Event Stream: raw canonical events

State Stream: periodic state summaries

8. Edge Cache Taxonomy

8.1 Edge Roles

Engine Edge: used by NS engines to read/write context quickly

UI Edge: used by Firmament/operator surfaces to render instantly

8.2 Edge Data Modes

Write-through: events published upstream immediately

Write-behind: buffer locally, flush on reconnect

Read-through: cache miss calls Core

Pre-warmed: subscribe-first, snapshot bootstrap

8.3 Sync States

cold_start

bootstrapping

in_sync

degraded

reconciling

stale

9. Governance and Control Taxonomy (Intervention ↔ GGP)

9.1 Transition Classes

Unprotected: Intervention accepts and projects without GGP gating

Protected: requires GGP decision/approval reference

Quarantined: accepted but not projected until reviewed

9.2 Policy Outcomes (from GGP)

allow

deny

allow_with_conditions

escalate

10. Firmament-Oriented Taxonomy (Visualization)

10.1 Render Objects

Node: entity/workflow/engine/decision

Edge: causal or dependency link

Pulse: event/delta visualization primitive

10.2 Visual Channels (logical)

Global Feed: high-level system activity

Threads: correlation-centric storylines

Hotspots: regions/entities with high change frequency

Incidents: failure and mitigation lifecycles

11. Canonical Naming Conventions

11.1 Event Types

Format:

verb_past_tense or noun_verb_past_tense
Examples:

request_created

policy_checked

approval_granted

execution_failed

projection_rebuilt

11.2 IDs

IDs are globally unique and stable.

Correlation IDs are reused across the full lifecycle of a thread.

12. Summary

This taxonomy standardizes Intervention’s language so NS can:

integrate engines consistently

stream coherent state to Firmament

reconstruct history reliably

enforce governance gating predictably

Intervention’s taxonomy is the backbone of NS coherence.

# NS-CON-010-FE — Frontend / UX

## Screens
- Connector Catalog (browse connectors, versions, docs)
- Connections (create instance, configure auth, validate, enable/disable)
- Runs (history, status, throughput, failures)
- Schema (discovery, diffs, drift alerts)
- DLQ (filter, inspect redacted payloads, replay)
- Policies (scopes, allowlists, data classification per connection)

## UX Principles
- Make “what data moves where” obvious.
- Make failure reasons actionable (error class + next steps).
- Never display secrets; show only secret refs and scope summaries.

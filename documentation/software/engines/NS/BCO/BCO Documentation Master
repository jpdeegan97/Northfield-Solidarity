NS-BCO — Business Continuity Operations

Naming decisions (to resolve the acronym collisions)

You’ve chosen:

NS-OCP — Onchain Compute Plane (the former “Compute Plane” engine)

To avoid the standard acronym BCP (Business Continuity Planning/Program/Protocol) and keep names unambiguous across Northfield Solidarity, rename the continuity engine to:

NS-BCO — Business Continuity Operations (applied in this doc)

Migration notes

Old continuity references: NS-BCO-*

New continuity references: NS-BCO-*

Compute plane references: NS-OCP-*

NS-BCO-000-CHARTER

1. Purpose

Establish a repeatable, testable, auditable continuity capability so Northfield Solidarity can:

Continue critical business services during disruptions.

Recover within defined RTO/RPO targets.

Reduce operational, financial, legal, and reputational risk.

2. Scope

This protocol covers:

People, process, technology, suppliers, and facilities.

Disruptions: cloud/provider outages, cyber incidents, data corruption, insider error, supply chain failures, regional disasters, key-person loss, and regulatory/contractual incidents.

Out of scope (handled by other programs, but integrated):

Product feature roadmap, general security architecture, and long-term corporate strategy.

3. Objectives

Define a tiered service inventory and continuity requirements.

Maintain BIA (Business Impact Analysis) and risk register.

Implement DR patterns: backups, replication, failover, and restoration runbooks.

Run exercises (tabletop + technical) and track results.

Produce artifacts auditors/customers request: policies, test evidence, and change logs.

4. Success metrics

% critical services with approved BIA + RTO/RPO

Backup coverage and restore test pass rate

DR exercise completion and time-to-recover vs targets

Incident MTTR for continuity-impacting events

NS-BCO-001-OVERVIEW

What this is

Business Continuity Protocol is the operating system for staying online (or recovering quickly) when things go wrong.

What it is not

Not “just disaster recovery.” DR is a subset.

Not “just backups.” Backups without restore validation are fiction.

Core concepts

BIA: what matters, how fast it must recover, and what data loss is tolerable.

RTO: max acceptable downtime.

RPO: max acceptable data loss (time).

Continuity strategies: redundancy, failover, graceful degradation, manual workarounds.

Exercises: prove reality, uncover gaps.

NS-BCO-002-TAXONOMY

Service tiers

Tier 0 (Existential): identity/auth, billing, customer data plane, core APIs.

Tier 1 (Critical): internal ops tools, CI/CD for production hotfixes, incident comms.

Tier 2 (Important): analytics, non-critical batch jobs.

Tier 3 (Deferrable): dev sandboxes, experiments.

Disruption categories

Cyber: ransomware, credential compromise, destructive actions.

Platform: cloud region outage, DNS failure, certificate issues.

Data: corruption, accidental deletion, bad migrations.

People: key-person loss, staffing gaps.

Supply chain: vendor failure, third-party API outage.

Facilities: power/network loss where on-prem exists.

Artifact taxonomy

Policies: high-level rules (approved).

Standards: concrete requirements (RTO/RPO, backup cadence).

Runbooks: step-by-step execution.

Evidence: test logs, tickets, signoffs.

NS-BCO-003-ARCHITECTURE

1. Program architecture (governance)

BCP Owner: accountable for program health.

Service Owners: accountable for their services meeting continuity requirements.

Incident Commander (IC): leads during incidents.

Scribe/Comms Lead: timeline + comms.

2. Continuity architecture (technical)

Minimum patterns

Backups: automated, encrypted, immutable/append-only where possible.

Restore validation: scheduled restores to prove integrity.

Separation of duties: restore keys and delete permissions controlled.

Dependency mapping: service → datastore → third parties.

Strategy patterns by tier

Tier 0: multi-AZ, potential multi-region, hot/warm standby.

Tier 1: multi-AZ + tested restore, warm standby as needed.

Tier 2/3: restore-only, longer RTO acceptable.

3. Communications architecture

Primary: incident channel + paging + status page.

Secondary: SMS/phone tree if chat/email down.

External: customer notifications and partner contacts.

NS-BCO-004-LIFECYCLE

Discover: inventory services + owners + dependencies.

Analyze: BIA → tier assignment → RTO/RPO.

Design: continuity strategy selection (redundancy vs restore-only).

Implement: backups/replication, runbooks, tooling.

Validate: restore tests, failover drills.

Exercise: tabletop + technical scenarios.

Improve: gaps → backlog items → re-test.

Audit-ready: evidence packaged and linked.

NS-BCO-005-DECISION

Decision principles

Truth over theater: only tested capabilities count.

Tier drives spend: higher tier earns higher cost.

Simple beats clever: recovery must work at 3AM.

Automate what’s repeated: reduce human error under stress.

NS-BCO-008-EEE (End-to-End Example)

Scenario: Primary DB accidental deletion

Detection: alerts show error spike, DB unreachable.

Declare incident: IC assigned, severity set.

Contain: block destructive credentials, freeze deployments.

Assess: confirm scope + last known good backup.

Restore:

Provision replacement DB

Restore from immutable snapshot

Re-point services

Validate:

Smoke tests

Data integrity checks

Communicate:

Internal updates every 15–30 min

External notice if customer impact

Postmortem:

Root cause

Preventive controls (least privilege, MFA, change gates)

Update runbook + schedule repeat test

NS-BCO-009-IMPL (Implementation Standard)

1. BIA implementation

Every service must have a BIA within 30 days of being production-critical.

Re-run BIA at least quarterly or after major architecture changes.

2. Backup/restore implementation

Backups encrypted at rest + in transit.

At least one backup copy must be logically isolated (separate account/project) or immutable.

Restore tests:

Tier 0/1: monthly

Tier 2: quarterly

Tier 3: semi-annually

3. DR implementation

If multi-region: document failover criteria and DNS switching.

If restore-only: document provisioning + restore time budget.

4. Access and secrets

Break-glass accounts: controlled, monitored, and rotated.

Backups/restore keys: stored with strict RBAC and audit logs.

Run a tabletop exercise and capture evidence.

# NS-BCO-001 — OVERVIEW

## What this is

Business Continuity Operations (BCO) is the operating system for staying online (or recovering quickly) when things go wrong.

## What it is not

*   **Not “just disaster recovery.”** DR is a subset.
*   **Not “just backups.”** Backups without restore validation are fiction.

## Core concepts

*   **BIA (Business Impact Analysis):** what matters, how fast it must recover, and what data loss is tolerable.
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** max acceptable downtime.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** max acceptable data loss (time).
*   **Continuity strategies:** redundancy, failover, graceful degradation, manual workarounds.
*   **Exercises:** prove reality, uncover gaps.

# NS-BCO-004 — LIFECYCLE

The Business Continuity Operations lifecycle ensures that continuity is not a one-time project, but a continuous loop of improvement.

1.  **Discover:** inventory services + owners + dependencies.
2.  **Analyze:** BIA (Business Impact Analysis) → tier assignment → RTO/RPO.
3.  **Design:** continuity strategy selection (redundancy vs restore-only).
4.  **Implement:** backups/replication, runbooks, tooling.
5.  **Validate:** restore tests, failover drills.
6.  **Exercise:** tabletop + technical scenarios.
7.  **Improve:** gaps → backlog items → re-test.
8.  **Audit-ready:** evidence packaged and linked.

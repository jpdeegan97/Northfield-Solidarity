# NS-BCO-005 — DECISION

## Decision principles

*   **Truth over theater:** only tested capabilities count.
*   **Tier drives spend:** higher tier earns higher cost.
*   **Simple beats clever:** recovery must work at 3AM.
*   **Automate what’s repeated:** reduce human error under stress.

## Decision records (template)

Every major continuity decision (e.g., "Use Multi-Region for Service X") should be recorded using this template:

*   **Context:** (Background, problem statement)
*   **Options considered:** (Alternatives evaluated)
*   **Rationale:** (Why we chose this option)
*   **Consequences:** (Cost, complexity, risks accepted)
*   **Owners:** (Who is responsible)
*   **Review date:** (When we re-evaluate)

1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE).
The taxonomy establishes a shared vocabulary and set of atomic primitives used across PIE and its downstream consumers (SIM, DAT, GGP, PTE). Its goal is to ensure that:
  Insights are structurally consistent
  Reasoning is explainable and auditable
  No downstream system must infer meaning implicitly
All PIE data models, APIs, events, and scoring logic must conform to this taxonomy.
2. Core Taxonomy Principles
PIE taxonomy follows these principles:
 Composability — Complex insights are built from small, well-defined primitives
 Explainability — Every insight can be decomposed into evidence and reasoning
 Versionability — All primitives are versioned and historically traceable
 Decay Awareness — Time relevance is explicit, never implied
 Governance Compatibility — All primitives map cleanly into GGP controls
3. Top-Level PIE Objects
3.1 Insight
An Insight is the primary output of PIE.
It represents a candidate opportunity or market hypothesis that is supported by evidence and bounded by uncertainty.
An Insight:
  Is proposed, never executed
  Is versioned
  Has a bounded lifetime
  Can be promoted, rejected, or expired
Key Attributes:
  Insight ID
  Opportunity Statement
  Insight Type
  Confidence Score
  Risk Profile
  Decay Model
  Status (Proposed / Reviewed / Approved / Rejected / Expired)
3.2 Opportunity Statement
The Opportunity Statement is a concise, human-readable articulation of the insight.
It answers:
What should we consider doing, and in what context?
It must be:
  Action-oriented but non-prescriptive
  Understandable without reading raw data
  Stable across minor evidence changes
4. Supporting Evidence Primitives
4.1 Signal Reference
A Signal Reference links an Insight to one or more signals produced by SIG.
Signals provide observable facts, not conclusions.
Attributes:
  Signal ID
  Source
  Trust Score
  Timestamp
  Signal Type
4.2 Research Artifact
A Research Artifact links an Insight to deeper analysis produced by DRE.
Artifacts provide context, background, and long-horizon reasoning.
Attributes:
  Artifact ID
  Research Topic
  Confidence Annotation
  Version
4.3 Evidence Bundle
An Evidence Bundle is a logical grouping of signals and research artifacts that jointly support an Insight.
Evidence Bundles allow downstream systems to:
  Inspect supporting facts
  Weigh corroboration vs contradiction
  Audit reasoning chains
5. Reasoning & Scoring Primitives
5.1 Scoring Model
A Scoring Model defines how PIE evaluates and compares Insights.
Scoring models are:
  Explicit
  Versioned
  Replayable
They may incorporate:
  Signal strength
  Source diversity
  Market momentum
  Historical analogs
5.2 Confidence Score
The Confidence Score represents PIE’s internal belief in the Insight’s validity.
It is:
  Quantitative
  Model-derived
  Explicitly separated from risk
5.3 Risk Profile
The Risk Profile captures known downside factors.
It may include:
  Market risk
  Execution complexity
  Regulatory uncertainty
  Data sparsity
Risk does not negate confidence; it contextualizes it.
6. Time & Relevance Primitives
6.1 Decay Model
The Decay Model defines how an Insight loses relevance over time.
Decay may be:
  Time-based
  Event-based
  Signal-driven
Insights without fresh evidence must decay.
6.2 Relevance Window
The Relevance Window defines the time horizon in which the Insight is actionable.
Outside this window, Insights are considered historical context only.
7. State & Lifecycle Primitives
7.1 Insight Status
An Insight transitions through explicit states:
  Proposed
  Under Review
  Approved (by GGP)
  Rejected
  Expired
State transitions are auditable events.
7.2 Promotion Readiness
Promotion Readiness indicates whether an Insight may be handed off to SIM or DAT.
It is a function of:
  Confidence thresholds
  Risk tolerance
  Governance rules
PIE never self-promotes.
8. Cross-Engine Mapping

Risk Profile

Decay Model
PTE, GGP
9. Constraints & Invariants
The following invariants must always hold:
  An Insight must reference at least one Signal or Research Artifact
  Confidence and Risk are never conflated
  All scores reference a Scoring Model version
  Expired Insights cannot be promoted
10. Document Position in PIE Corpus
This taxonomy document is foundational.
It informs:
  NS-PIE-003 — ARCHITECTURE
  NS-PIE-004 — LIFECYCLE
  NS-PIE-005+ — scoring, governance, and replay semantics

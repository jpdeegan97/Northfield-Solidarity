Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the end-to-end lifecycle of an Insight within the Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE).
The lifecycle formalizes:
How insights are created
How they evolve over time
How they interact with governance, simulation, and execution engines
How they decay, expire, or are rejected
The objective is to ensure predictability, auditability, and governance alignment from insight inception to retirement.
2. Lifecycle Design Principles
PIE lifecycle design adheres to the following principles:
Explicit State Transitions — No implicit promotion or decay
Governance First — All promotions cross GGP
Time Awareness — Relevance is always bounded
Replayability — Historical lifecycle paths can be reconstructed
Non-Executional — PIE never triggers action directly
3. High-Level Lifecycle Flow
At a high level, an Insight flows through the following phases:
Signal & Research Intake
Context Assembly
Insight Proposal
Scoring & Risk Annotation
Governance Review
Downstream Consumption (SIM / DAT)
Performance Feedback
Decay, Expiry, or Rejection
Each phase emits auditable events and persists state transitions.
4. Insight States
4.1 Proposed
Entry Condition:
Evidence Bundle assembled
Opportunity Statement generated
Characteristics:
Not visible for execution
May be visible for internal review
Permitted Transitions:
→ Under Review
→ Rejected
4.2 Under Review
Entry Condition:
Insight submitted for governance evaluation
Actors Involved:
GGP (decision authority)
Human reviewers (optional)
Permitted Transitions:
→ Approved
→ Rejected
→ Proposed (revision)
4.3 Approved
Entry Condition:
Governance approval granted by GGP
Characteristics:
Eligible for downstream consumption
Still non-executing
Downstream Visibility:
SIM (scenario analysis)
DAT (execution planning)
Permitted Transitions:
→ Expired
→ Rejected (post-approval revocation)
4.4 Rejected
Entry Condition:
Governance or human rejection
Characteristics:
Retained for audit and learning
Not eligible for downstream use
Permitted Transitions:
None (terminal)
4.5 Expired
Entry Condition:
Relevance window exceeded
Decay threshold crossed
Characteristics:
Insight becomes historical context only
Permitted Transitions:
None (terminal)
5. Lifecycle Phase Detail
5.1 Intake Phase
Signals ingested from SIG
Research artifacts ingested from DRE
Intake events recorded
No insights are created at this stage.
5.2 Context Assembly Phase
Signals and research grouped into Evidence Bundles
Context snapshots persisted
This phase is deterministic and replayable.
5.3 Insight Proposal Phase
Opportunity Statement generated
Insight created with status = Proposed
Initial decay and relevance windows assigned
5.4 Scoring & Risk Phase
Scoring models applied
Confidence Score computed
Risk Profile attached
Scoring does not change insight state.
5.5 Governance Review Phase
Insight submitted to GGP
Review outcomes recorded
PIE cannot override governance decisions.
5.6 Downstream Consumption Phase
Approved insights consumed by:SIM for scenario analysisDAT for execution planning
PIE observes but does not control outcomes.
5.7 Feedback & Observation Phase
Execution and performance signals return via PTE / FLO
Feedback linked to originating Insight
Feedback does not mutate original Insight content.
5.8 Decay & Expiry Phase
Relevance evaluated continuously
Ranking prominence reduced over time
Expiry event emitted when thresholds crossed
6. Event Emissions
Each lifecycle transition emits an immutable event, including:
pie.insight.proposed
pie.insight.reviewed
pie.insight.approved
pie.insight.rejected
pie.insight.expired
Events include:
Insight ID
Version
Timestamp
Actor (system / governance)
7. Invariants & Constraints
The following constraints must always hold:
An Insight cannot be approved without governance
An expired Insight cannot be reactivated
State transitions are append-only
Decay never deletes historical records

Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the versioning rules and semantics for PIE artifacts, ensuring that:
Insight evolution is historically traceable
Replay and auditability are preserved
Downstream engines can reason about change impact
Versioning applies to:
Insights (primary)
Evidence Bundles
Scoring Models and Score Outputs
Risk Profiles
Narratives
Decision Contexts
This document complements the canonical data model in NS-PIE-007.
2. Versioning Principles
PIE versioning follows these principles:
Semantic Changes Create New VersionsIf meaning changes, a new version is created.
Non-Semantic Updates Do Not Rewrite HistoryAll updates are append-only. Non-semantic updates create new records but may not require a new insight_version.
Explicit CausalityEach version links to what caused it (evidence change, model change, governance change).
Downstream StabilityDownstream consumers should be able to pin to a specific version.
3. Canonical Versioned Identifiers
3.1 insight_id vs insight_version
insight_id is stable across the life of the Insight.
insight_version increments when the Insight’s semantic content changes.
All authoritative PIE records are keyed by:
(insight_id, insight_version)
4. What Triggers a New Insight Version
A new insight_version MUST be created when any of the following changes:
Opportunity Statement Meaning Changes
The core “what/why” of the insight changes
Insight Type Changes
Reclassification that alters interpretation or handling
Evidence Composition Changes (Semantic)
Evidence Bundle changes that materially alter support
Risk Profile Changes (Material)
Risk band changes
Material risk flags added/removed
Relevance Window Meaning Changes
Time horizon materially shifted
Narrative Meaning Changes
Explanation changes in a way that alters the implied claim
5. What Does NOT Trigger a New Insight Version
The following changes do not require a new insight_version, but still produce new append-only records:
Derived Read Model Rebuilds
Rankings and caches
New Scoring Model Applied (Re-score)
Scores can be recomputed under a new model version
Store as a new scoring_result record
Decision Context Re-evaluation
New decision_context records appended
Minor Narrative Formatting
Styling, whitespace, non-meaningful edits
Decay State Updates
Time-based decay progression
6. Sub-Artifact Versioning
6.1 Scoring Models
Scoring Models are versioned independently:
scoring_model_id (stable)
scoring_model_version (monotonic)
A new scoring_model_version is required when:
scoring formula changes
feature set changes
weighting changes
6.2 Scoring Results
Scoring Results are immutable snapshots:
Reference (insight_id, insight_version)
Reference scoring_model_version
New scoring_result records are created whenever:
a new scoring model version is applied
new scores are computed
6.3 Evidence Bundles
Evidence Bundles are bound to an Insight version.
Rule:
If evidence changes materially → new insight_version
If evidence changes non-materially → new bundle record may be attached under same insight_version (rare; requires GGP-governed rule)
Default: evidence bundle changes imply semantic change.
6.4 Risk Profiles
Risk Profiles are versioned by append-only records.
Rule:
Material risk change → new insight_version
Non-material note updates → append risk_profile record without new insight_version
6.5 Narratives
Narratives are versioned snapshots.
Rule:
Meaning change → new insight_version
Formatting-only change → new narrative record without new insight_version
6.6 Decision Contexts
Decision contexts are immutable snapshots.
Rule:
Re-evaluations append new decision_context records
They never overwrite prior contexts
7. Governance & Version Control
PIE versioning rules must be:
Explicit
Enforced consistently
Governed by GGP
PIE may propose a new insight_version, but downstream promotion decisions remain governed.
8. Compatibility & Downstream Impact
Downstream engines should treat Insight versions as:
Pin-able: can reference a specific version for reproducibility
Comparable: can detect whether a new version invalidates prior assumptions
Recommended downstream behavior:
SIM re-evaluates scenarios when insight_version changes
DAT pauses execution planning if pinned version is superseded
PTE tracks performance aligned to the version that drove action
9. Document Position in PIE Corpus
This versioning document builds upon:
NS-PIE-002 — TAXONOMY
NS-PIE-004 — LIFECYCLE
NS-PIE-007 — DATAMODEL
It informs:
NS-PIE-008 — EEE
NS-PIE-009 — IMPL

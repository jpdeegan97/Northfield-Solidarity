1. Purpose
The Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE) is responsible for transforming fragmented market signals into coherent, explainable, and decision-ready product insights.
PIE exists to answer a single core question:
What products, markets, or opportunities are worth serious consideration — and why?
PIE does not execute actions, allocate capital, or authorize decisions. Its role is to surface truth, uncertainty, and confidence in a structured form that downstream engines and human operators can reason about.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
PIE sits in the intelligence layer of the Northfield Solidarity engine ecosystem.
It acts as the primary synthesis engine between:
  SIG (Signal Aggregation Engine): raw, normalized, trust-scored signals
  DRE (Deep Research Engine): long-horizon thematic and exploratory research
And downstream consumers:
  DAT (Digital Arbitrage Tooling): execution planning
  SIM (Simulation & Scenario Engine): counterfactual analysis
  GGP (Governance Graph Processor): approval, audit, and control
  Humans: strategic review and judgment
PIE converts data exhaust into decision context.
3. What PIE Produces
PIE produces Insights, which are structured, versioned artifacts composed of:
  A clear opportunity statement
  Supporting evidence and signals
  Quantified confidence and uncertainty
  Explicit risks and counter-signals
  Time-bound relevance and decay semantics
Outputs may take multiple forms:
  Ranked insight lists
  Event emissions to downstream engines
  Read-only query surfaces for humans
PIE outputs are always explainable and auditable.
4. What PIE Does Not Do
To preserve system clarity and safety, PIE explicitly does not:
  Execute trades, listings, or market actions (DAT)
  Simulate scenarios or financial outcomes (SIM, FLO)
  Approve or authorize actions (GGP)
  Manage identities, entities, or permissions (IDN, PECA)
PIE proposes. Others decide and act.
5. Core Capabilities
At a high level, PIE provides the following capabilities:
 Signal SynthesisAggregates and contextualizes signals from SIG and DRE.
 Insight GenerationForms candidate opportunities based on correlated evidence.
 Scoring & RankingApplies consistent, versioned scoring models to compare opportunities.
 Narrative ExplanationProduces human-readable rationales for each insight.
 Decay & Relevance ManagementEnsures stale insights lose prominence over time.
6. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to PIE
SIG
Supplies normalized, trust-scored signals
DRE
Supplies deep research artifacts and hypotheses
SIM
Consumes PIE insights for scenario testing
DAT
Consumes approved insights for execution planning
GGP
Governs promotion, approval, and audit of insights
PTE
Tracks performance of insight-driven initiatives
PIE never bypasses governance or execution controls.
7. Operational Posture
PIE is:
  Read-heavy for consumers
  Write-controlled through governed pipelines
  Deterministic given the same inputs and model versions
  Replayable for audit and model evolution
PIE is designed to support both human-in-the-loop and progressive automation workflows.
8. Expected Outcomes
When PIE is functioning correctly:
  High-quality opportunities surface earlier
  False positives are explainable and correctable
  Downstream engines operate with better context
  Governance decisions are faster and better-informed
PIE reduces noise, not judgment.
9. Document Position in PIE Corpus

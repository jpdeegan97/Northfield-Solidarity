NS-PIE-005 — DECISION
Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision semantics used by the Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE) to evaluate, qualify, and prepare Insights for governance review.
It formalizes:
What PIE decides versus what it merely recommends
How promotion readiness is determined
How confidence, risk, and uncertainty are treated
PIE decisioning is advisory and preparatory. All authoritative approval decisions are owned by GGP.
2. Decision Boundary Principles
PIE decision logic adheres to the following boundaries:
No Authority to Act — PIE never triggers execution
No Authority to Approve — PIE cannot self-promote insights
Explainability Required — All decision outputs must be decomposable
Governance Compatibility — Decisions must map cleanly to GGP review
PIE answers whether something is worth review, not whether it should be done.
3. Decision Objects
3.1 Promotion Readiness
Promotion Readiness is PIE’s primary decision output.
It represents a structured recommendation indicating whether an Insight:
Is ready for governance review
Requires additional evidence
Should be deprioritized or allowed to decay
Promotion Readiness is binary at the interface level (ready / not-ready), but internally justified with rich context.
3.2 Decision Context
Each decision is evaluated within a Decision Context composed of:
Evidence Bundle
Scoring Model outputs
Confidence Score
Risk Profile
Decay status
Known counter-signals
The Decision Context is immutable once evaluated.
4. Decision Inputs
PIE decision logic may consider the following inputs:
Signal Strength & Diversity (from SIG)
Research Support (from DRE)
Confidence Score (model-derived)
Risk Profile (explicit downside factors)
Relevance Window (time sensitivity)
Historical Analog Performance (if available)
All inputs must be explicitly referenced.
5. Decision Rules
5.1 Confidence Thresholds
PIE defines minimum confidence thresholds per Insight Type.
If confidence falls below threshold:
Promotion readiness = false
Insight remains Proposed
Thresholds are:
Explicit
Versioned
Governed by GGP
5.2 Risk Gating
High-risk Insights may still be promoted if risks are explicit and bounded.
Risk gating rules:
No hidden risks
No unbounded downside
All risks must be surfaced to governance
Risk does not veto confidence; it contextualizes it.
5.3 Evidence Sufficiency
An Insight must satisfy minimum evidence criteria:
At least one high-trust signal or
Multiple corroborating moderate-trust signals or
Strong research artifact support
Evidence sufficiency rules are deterministic.
5.4 Decay Constraints
If an Insight’s decay score crosses a defined threshold:
Promotion readiness is automatically set to false
Insight may still be reviewed manually
Decay prevents stale insights from auto-escalating.
6. Decision Outcomes
PIE decision logic produces one of the following outcomes:



Outcome

Description


Ready for Review

Submit to GGP


Not Ready

Remain Proposed


Deprioritized

Allow to decay
No decision outcome is terminal except via governance.
7. Governance Handoff
When Promotion Readiness = true:
Insight is packaged with full Decision Context
Submitted to GGP via governed interface
PIE emits a pie.insight.ready_for_review event
PIE does not influence review ordering or approval priority.
8. Constraints & Invariants
The following invariants must always hold:
Decisions reference explicit model versions
Decision context is immutable
PIE decisions are non-authoritative
All promotion decisions are auditable

Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides a complete end-to-end example illustrating how the Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE) operates in practice.
The goal is to:
Validate consistency across PIE documents (001–007)
Demonstrate replayability and auditability
Show clean interaction boundaries with SIG, DRE, SIM, DAT, GGP, and PTE
This example is illustrative but structurally accurate.
2. Scenario Overview
Scenario: Identification of a potential high-margin consumer product opportunity in a niche home category.
Context:
Emerging demand signals detected online
Limited but growing competitive presence
No execution decision yet made
PIE’s role is to surface, qualify, and contextualize the opportunity — not to act on it.
3. Phase 1 — Signal & Research Intake
3.1 Signals from SIG
SIG emits the following normalized signals:
Signal A: Increased search volume for a specific product attribute
Signal B: Sustained social media mentions with positive sentiment
Signal C: Marketplace listings showing rising sell-through
Each signal includes:
signal_id
Trust score
Timestamp
PIE ingests signals via the Signal Intake Adapter.
3.2 Research from DRE
DRE provides a research artifact:
Artifact R1: Long-horizon analysis indicating category growth driven by demographic shifts
Artifact includes:
artifact_id
Confidence annotation
Version
4. Phase 2 — Context Assembly
PIE assembles a Context Snapshot:
Groups Signals A, B, C
Links Research Artifact R1
Associates known constraints (e.g., regulatory considerations)
An Evidence Bundle is created:
bundle_id = EB-001
References all signal and artifact IDs
Evidence Bundle is persisted and replayable.
5. Phase 3 — Insight Proposal
Using the Evidence Bundle, PIE generates an Insight:
insight_id = INS-042
insight_version = 1
Opportunity Statement:“There may be an opportunity to enter the niche home category focused on [specific attribute], given rising consumer demand and limited competition.”
Insight state:
Status = Proposed
Decay and relevance windows are assigned.
6. Phase 4 — Scoring & Risk Annotation
6.1 Scoring
PIE applies Scoring Model v1.3:
Confidence Score: 0.74
Supporting score breakdown stored in scoring_result
6.2 Risk Profiling
Risk Profile identifies:
Moderate execution complexity
Supply chain uncertainty
Risk Profile attached without changing insight_version.
7. Phase 5 — Decision & Governance Handoff
7.1 Promotion Readiness Evaluation
Decision Context snapshot created:
Confidence above threshold
Risks explicit and bounded
Evidence sufficient
Promotion Readiness = true
7.2 Submission to GGP
PIE submits the Insight to GGP with:
Evidence Bundle
Narrative explanation
Decision Context
Event emitted:
pie.insight.ready_for_review
8. Phase 6 — Governance Review Outcome
GGP reviews the Insight:
Outcome: Approved for downstream analysis
Governance decision recorded
PIE records state transition:
Proposed → Approved
9. Phase 7 — Downstream Consumption
9.1 SIM
SIM consumes INS-042 v1 to:
Run downside scenarios
Identify sensitivity to demand assumptions
9.2 DAT
DAT consumes INS-042 v1 for planning only:
No execution triggered
PIE remains passive.
10. Phase 8 — Feedback & Observation
Execution planning later yields metrics:
Performance signals routed to PTE
Financial outcomes routed to FLO
PTE associates results with:
insight_id = INS-042
insight_version = 1
PIE does not mutate the original Insight.
11. Phase 9 — Decay & Expiry
After several months:
No new corroborating signals
Decay threshold crossed
PIE emits:
pie.insight.expired
Insight state transitions:
Approved → Expired
Insight remains queryable as historical context.
12. Replay & Audit Demonstration
An auditor replays the Insight:
Reconstructs Evidence Bundle from IDs
Re-runs Scoring Model v1.3
Confirms decision thresholds at the time
Result:
Original outcome is reproducible
13. Cross-Document Validation
This example validates:
NS-PIE-002 (Taxonomy primitives)
NS-PIE-003 (Architectural stages)
NS-PIE-004 (Lifecycle states)
NS-PIE-005 (Decision semantics)
NS-PIE-006 (Versioning rules)
NS-PIE-007 (Data model & replay)

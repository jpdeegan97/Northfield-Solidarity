Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This runbook defines the operational procedures, controls, and recovery actions required to safely operate the Product InsightIQ Engine (PIE) in production.
It is intended for:
Operators
Platform engineers
Governance reviewers
The runbook assumes PIE is running as a read-first, advisory system governed by GGP.
2. Operational Objectives
PIE operations must ensure:
Continuous intake of signals and research
Deterministic insight generation
Auditability and replay readiness
Zero execution side-effects
Safe recovery from partial failures
3. System Health & Readiness Checks
3.1 Startup Checklist
Before declaring PIE healthy:
Signal intake connectivity to SIG verified
Research intake connectivity to DRE verified
Authoritative datastore reachable (read/write)
Derived read-model store reachable
Active scoring model loaded
Governance control endpoints reachable
If any item fails, PIE must remain in safe mode (publication paused).
3.2 Safe Mode
Safe Mode Characteristics:
Signal and research intake continues
Insight generation continues
Publication and promotion are paused
No downstream events emitted
Safe mode may be entered:
Automatically (on dependency failure)
Manually (via governed control)
4. Normal Operations
4.1 Signal & Research Intake
Expected behavior:
Continuous ingestion
Backpressure applied on burst conditions
Monitoring:
Intake lag
Drop rate (by trust threshold)
4.2 Insight Generation Pipeline
Expected behavior:
Deterministic generation
Idempotent processing per evidence bundle
Monitoring:
Candidate insight rate
Error rate by pipeline stage
4.3 Scoring & Decision Evaluation
Expected behavior:
Active scoring model version applied
Promotion readiness evaluated
Monitoring:
Score distributions
Promotion-ready rate
5. Governance Operations
5.1 Promotion to GGP
Procedure:
Verify promotion readiness true
Submit package to GGP
Confirm governance receipt
PIE must not retry submissions blindly; retries must be idempotent.
5.2 Governance Decision Intake
When GGP responds:
Record state transition
Persist governance reference ID
Update derived read models
6. Replay & Backfill Procedures
6.1 Read Model Rebuild
Use when:
Derived models are corrupted
Ranking logic updated
Procedure:
Pause publication
Drop derived tables
Rebuild from authoritative store
Validate counts and checksums
Resume publication
6.2 Score Replay
Use when:
New scoring model version activated
Procedure:
Activate new scoring model (governed)
Recompute scores for historical insights
Append new scoring_result records
Validate score distributions
6.3 Decision Replay
Use when:
Promotion thresholds change
Procedure:
Pause promotion
Re-evaluate promotion readiness
Append new decision_context records
Resume promotion
7. Failure Scenarios & Responses
7.1 SIG Unavailable
Response:
Enter safe mode
Buffer incoming events if possible
Alert operators
7.2 DRE Unavailable
Response:
Continue signal-only insights
Flag reduced confidence
Alert operators
7.3 Authoritative Store Failure
Response:
Halt insight generation
Enter safe mode
Prevent state mutation
7.4 Derived Store Failure
Response:
Serve degraded read experience if possible
Schedule rebuild
8. Observability & Alerts
Key metrics:
Intake lag
Insight generation throughput
Promotion-ready rate
Error rate by stage
Replay duration
Alerts:
Dependency loss
Score distribution anomalies
Unexpected promotion spikes
9. Security & Access Controls
Read APIs are read-only
Control APIs are GGP-governed
All control actions emit auditable events
10. Operational Invariants
PIE never executes actions
PIE never mutates historical records
Publication can always be paused
Replay never overwrites history

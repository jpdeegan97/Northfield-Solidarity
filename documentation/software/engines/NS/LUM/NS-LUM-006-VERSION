NS-LUM-006 — VERSION

0. Overview

This document defines versioning rules for LUM (Luminance Engine) across:

telemetry schemas (logs/events)

correlation standards

alert rules

SLI/SLO definitions

incident workflows/runbooks

evidence bundle formats

LUM APIs and SDKs

Goal: changes remain traceable, reversible, and compatible across engines.

1. Versioning Principles

Everything versioned: schemas, rules, SLOs, runbooks, SDKs.

Immutable history: published versions never mutate; changes create new versions.

Compatibility by default: additive changes preferred.

Deterministic replay: older telemetry remains interpretable.

Governance interlock: changes affecting audit/evidence/retention require GGP gate.

2. Versioning Scheme (Canonical)

Use Semantic Versioning for most LUM artifacts:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR: breaking changes

MINOR: backward-compatible additions

PATCH: backward-compatible fixes

For high-frequency objects (alerts, SLO tuning), allow monotonic revision IDs but still keep semver at the “policy pack” level.

3. Artifact-Specific Rules

3.1 Telemetry/Event Schemas

Schema ID format

lum.<signal_type>.<domain>.<name>

e.g., lum.event.integration.webhook_received

Version rules

MAJOR: type change, meaning change, removal, new required field without default

MINOR: new optional field, new enum value (if safely handled), new nested object

PATCH: documentation clarifications, non-functional constraints, bug fix in validation

Compatibility requirement

Consumers must tolerate unknown fields.

Producers must not rely on consumers understanding new fields during rollout.

3.2 Correlation Standard

Correlation standard defines required fields and propagation.

Version rules

MAJOR: changing required field set or semantics

MINOR: adding recommended fields, adding optional fields

PATCH: clarification/typos

Change discipline

New required correlation fields require a migration window and a GGP-approved rollout plan.

3.3 Alert Rules

Alert rules can be tuned frequently; versioning must preserve explainability.

Rule ID format

lum.alert.<domain>.<name>

Version rules

MAJOR: changes that alter paging semantics or severity mapping significantly

MINOR: threshold tuning, added filters, improved grouping/dedupe

PATCH: bug fixes, description updates

Operational requirement

Every fired alert must record the rule_id and rule_version.

3.4 SLIs/SLOs

SLO ID format

lum.slo.<service_or_workflow>.<objective>

Version rules

MAJOR: target/window definition changes that alter historical comparability

MINOR: minor tuning where comparability is preserved (or explicitly annotated)

PATCH: metadata fixes

Recordkeeping

SLO evaluations store which SLO version applied.

3.5 Incident Workflow & Templates

Includes incident states, required fields, postmortem templates.

Version rules

MAJOR: state model changes, new required closure fields

MINOR: additional optional fields/sections

PATCH: formatting fixes

3.6 Runbooks

Runbooks are living docs but must be traceable.

Version rules

MAJOR: procedure changes that alter risk/impact or require new permissions

MINOR: additional checks, clearer steps

PATCH: typo fixes

Operational requirement

Incidents reference the runbook ID + version used.

3.7 Evidence Bundle Format

Evidence bundles are audit-adjacent and high-stakes.

Version rules

MAJOR: changes to sealing/integrity fields, required artifacts schema

MINOR: optional metadata additions

PATCH: documentation

Governance requirement

Any MAJOR/MINOR affecting evidence meaning or access classification must be reviewed under GGP.

3.8 LUM APIs

API changes must be safe for client engines.

Rules

Version APIs at the path or header level (e.g., /v1/…).

MAJOR: breaking request/response changes

MINOR: additive fields/endpoints

PATCH: bug fixes

Deprecation policy

Maintain at least one prior major for a defined sunset window.

3.9 LUM SDKs

SDKs wrap logging/tracing/event emission.

Rules

semver required

MAJOR: breaking API changes

MINOR: new helpers

PATCH: fixes

4. Deprecation & Sunset Policy

4.1 Deprecation stages

announced

deprecated

sunset_pending

retired

4.2 Minimum windows (starter)

Schemas: 60–180 days depending on scope

APIs: 180 days for major versions

Alert rules: may change faster, but must keep a revision trail

4.3 Migration requirements

compatibility notes

rollout plan (producer-first vs consumer-first)

test plan and rollback strategy

5. Release Management

5.1 Release units

LUM Platform release (services)

Telemetry standard pack (schemas + correlation + redaction policies)

Alert/SLO pack (rules + objectives)

5.2 Required release artifacts

changelog

migration notes

risk assessment

validation plan

5.3 Rollback rules

rollbacks must preserve data compatibility

major schema changes require dual-write/dual-read or translation layer during transition

6. Traceability Requirements

Every emitted signal and operational artifact should be able to reference:

schema_id + schema_version

correlation_standard_version

rule_id + rule_version (for alerts)

slo_id + slo_version

runbook_id + runbook_version

bundle_format_version (for evidence)

7. Governance Interlock (GGP)

Changes that require a GGP gate (minimum):

new required audit/evidence fields

retention class changes for sensitive data

access control model changes

evidence bundle sealing/integrity logic changes

paging/escalation policy changes that affect who gets alerted

LUM records the decision_id authorizing such changes.

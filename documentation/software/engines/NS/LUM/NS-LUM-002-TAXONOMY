NS-LUM-002 — TAXONOMY

0. Overview

This document defines the canonical taxonomy for LUM (Luminance Engine). The goal is to standardize language and structures for telemetry, reliability, incidents, alerts, evidence support, and cross-engine correlation.

LUM terminology is organized into:

Signals (logs, metrics, traces, events)

Correlation identifiers (how signals stitch together)

Reliability constructs (SLIs/SLOs, error budgets)

Incidents and response (severity, states, runbooks)

Evidence support (audit bundles, chain-of-custody)

1. Core Signal Taxonomy

1.1 Telemetry Signal

A Telemetry Signal is any machine-readable observation emitted by an engine or platform component.

Signal types

Log — discrete records (structured, redacted)

Metric — numerical time series

Trace — distributed span graph (trace/span)

Event — semantic domain event (workflow, integration, decision)

Minimum signal envelope (recommended)

signal_id

signal_type (log|metric|trace|event)

occurred_at

source_engine

service / component

environment (dev|uat|prod)

severity (if applicable)

Correlation IDs (see Section 2)

1.2 Log

A Log is a structured record describing an execution moment.

Log categories

audit (governed actions metadata)

security (auth failures, access violations)

application (business logic)

integration (external API calls)

system (infra/runtime)

Log levels (canonical)

debug | info | warn | error | fatal

1.3 Metric

A Metric is a numeric measurement captured over time.

Metric classes

Counter (monotonic counts, e.g., requests_total)

Gauge (current value, e.g., queue_depth)

Histogram (distribution, e.g., latency_ms)

Summary (approx quantiles)

Metric domains

Traffic (requests, events)

Errors (failures, retries)

Latency (p50/p95/p99)

Saturation (CPU, memory, queue depth)

Correctness (idempotency collisions, schema mismatches)

1.4 Trace

A Trace is a causal graph of Spans representing a single request or workflow across services.

Core trace terms

Trace: end-to-end request boundary

Span: timed operation within a trace

Parent/Child: nesting relationships

Attributes: key/value metadata (redacted)

1.5 Event

An Event is a semantic record describing something that happened in the domain.

Event classes

Workflow events (task created, step completed)

Decision events (policy evaluated, approval granted)

Integration events (webhook received, quota exceeded)

Data events (ingestion started/finished, transform failed)

Event envelope (minimum)

event_id, event_type, occurred_at

source_engine

Correlation IDs (Section 2)

payload_ref (optional pointer to raw payload)

2. Correlation Taxonomy (Canonical Identifiers)

Correlation IDs allow LUM to stitch signals into a coherent narrative.

2.1 Required correlation identifiers (minimum set)

request_id — single request boundary

trace_id — distributed trace boundary

span_id — span boundary

workflow_id — multi-step process boundary (cross-engine)

task_id — CWP work item identifier (if applicable)

job_id — executor job identifier (CDE/DAT/MUX pipelines)

entity_id — IDN entity reference (person/org/account)

actor_id — concrete actor (human/agent/service principal)

integration_id — external integration identifier (e.g., EXT-COINBASE-COMMERCE)

decision_id — governing decision reference (GGP)

2.2 Context tags (recommended)

environment (dev|uat|prod)

region / cluster

tenant_id (if multi-tenant)

customer_id (if applicable)

session_id

3. Reliability Taxonomy

3.1 SLI (Service Level Indicator)

An SLI is a measurable indicator of service health.

Common SLIs

availability (successful requests / total)

latency (p95 response time)

correctness (valid outputs / total)

freshness (data age)

durability (job completion success)

3.2 SLO (Service Level Objective)

An SLO is a target for an SLI over a time window.

Examples

“99.9% successful webhook processing over 30 days”

“p95 latency < 250ms for decision evaluation over 7 days”

3.3 Error Budget

An Error Budget is the allowable failure rate implied by an SLO.

Uses

gating risky releases

controlling automation aggressiveness

prioritizing reliability work when budget is exhausted

3.4 Alert

An Alert is a triggered condition requiring attention.

Alert types

Symptom alerts (SLO burn, error spikes)

Cause alerts (dependency down)

Predictive alerts (quota nearing limit)

Governance alerts (approval timeout, missing evidence)

Alert routing terms

Route: mapping from alert type/severity → destination

Escalation: time-based increase in attention

Deduplication: merge repeated alerts

Suppression: intentional silencing under conditions

3.5 Incident

An Incident is a managed disruption to expected service behavior.

Incident types

availability outage

partial degradation

data correctness issue

security incident

integration disruption (provider error/quota)

Incident severity (canonical)

SEV0 — existential / system-wide outage or severe security breach

SEV1 — major outage or materially harmful malfunction

SEV2 — significant degradation, workaround exists

SEV3 — minor issue, limited blast radius

SEV4 — informational / maintenance

Incident states (canonical)

detected

triaging

mitigating

monitoring

resolved

closed

4. Integration Observability Taxonomy

4.1 External Integration

An External Integration is any provider API/webhook used by NS.

Examples

Coinbase Commerce

Google Maps Platform

Google Workspace APIs

Core terms

Provider: vendor/platform (Coinbase, Google)

Connector: adapter module implementing provider calls

Webhook Receiver: endpoint ingesting provider callbacks

Idempotency Key: token guaranteeing safe retries

4.2 Integration health signals

request success rate

provider error codes distribution

quota consumption and remaining budget

retry rate and backoff behavior

webhook verification failures

delivery/settlement latency

4.3 Integration failure modes (canonical)

auth_failed (expired/revoked creds)

rate_limited (429/quotas)

provider_outage

schema_change

timeout

invalid_signature (webhooks)

idempotency_collision

5. Audit Evidence Support Taxonomy

5.1 Audit Event

An Audit Event is a governed action record required by GGP.

“payment captured”

“policy updated”

“access granted”

“approval given/denied”

actor_id

entity_id (if applicable)

decision_id (GGP)

occurred_at

inputs_ref / outputs_ref

Correlation IDs

5.2 Evidence Artifact

An Evidence Artifact is an object referenced to prove correctness/compliance.

receipt, invoice PDF

webhook payload hash + signature verification record

approval screenshot/link

provider delivery receipt (post URL, message ID)

Core properties

artifact_id

artifact_type

storage_ref

hash (integrity)

created_at

access_policy_ref

5.3 Evidence Bundle

An Evidence Bundle groups all artifacts and audit events that support a governed action.

bundle_type (payment, publication, permission_change, etc.)

decision_id

workflow_id

artifacts[]

audit_events[]

seal_status (open|sealed)

5.4 Chain of custody

Chain of custody is metadata proving who accessed/modified/transported evidence.

Core terms

Access log: record of reads

Immutability policy: WORM/append-only controls

Sealing: marking a bundle immutable after completion

6. Operational Terms

6.1 Runbook

A Runbook is a prescriptive procedure to diagnose and resolve an alert/incident.

Runbook components

symptoms

impact

checks

mitigations

rollback steps

validation steps

escalation contacts

6.2 Postmortem

A Postmortem is the structured analysis of an incident.

Postmortem sections

6.3 Action Item

An Action Item is a tracked remediation task, typically handed to CWP.

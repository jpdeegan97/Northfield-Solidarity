NS-LUM-005 — DECISION

0. Overview

This document defines the decision model used by LUM (Luminance Engine).

Important boundary:

GGP is the authority for governance decisions (approve/deny actions, evidence requirements, access control).

LUM makes operational decisions that affect observability and reliability operations (alerting, incident creation, sampling, routing), and it emits signals that inform GGP decisions.

LUM decisions must be:

deterministic where possible

explainable (why did LUM alert, suppress, sample, or create an incident?)

auditable (decision events stored and correlated)

1. Decision Domains

1.1 Alerting decisions

Should an alert trigger?

What severity should it be?

Should it be deduped/grouped with an existing alert?

Should it be suppressed?

Who should receive it?

1.2 Incident decisions

Should an incident be created automatically?

What incident type and severity?

Should it be linked to an existing incident?

When should it be escalated?

1.3 Telemetry routing & retention decisions

Should a signal go to hot vs warm vs archive?

Should a signal be promoted to evidence tier?

How long should it be retained (class assignment)?

1.4 Sampling decisions (traces/logs)

Should this trace be sampled?

Should it be tail-sampled due to an error or important workflow?

Should detailed debug logs be enabled temporarily?

1.5 Integration health decisions

Is an external integration degraded?

Should retry strategies be adjusted (rate-limit backoff hints)?

Should a “degraded mode” advisory be emitted to other engines?

1.6 Evidence support decisions (non-governance)

Is an evidence bundle complete enough to be marked ready_to_seal?

Has integrity verification passed (hash/signature)?

Sealing policy and access policy are governed by GGP; LUM only evaluates completeness/integrity and requests sealing.

2. Decision Inputs (Signals)

2.1 Telemetry inputs

metrics (SLIs, burn rates)

logs (error patterns)

traces (error spans, latency)

events (workflow milestones)

2.2 Context inputs

environment (dev/uat/prod)

service criticality tier

integration criticality tier

maintenance windows

known incidents/ongoing mitigations

ownership metadata

2.3 Governance inputs (references)

GGP policies for:

evidence retention classes

sensitive field rules

access constraints

incident notification constraints (who can be paged)

3. Decision Objects

LUM produces structured decision artifacts.

3.1 Alert Decision

alert_decision_id

decision_type = alert

rule_id (or SLO id)

triggered = true|false

severity

group_key

route

rationale (machine + human readable)

Correlation IDs

3.2 Incident Decision

incident_decision_id

decision_type = incident

create_incident = true|false

severity

incident_type

linked_incident_id (optional)

escalation_policy_id

rationale

3.3 Routing Decision

routing_decision_id

decision_type = routing

signal_type

retention_class (hot|warm|cold|evidence)

storage_targets[]

rationale

3.4 Sampling Decision

sampling_decision_id

decision_type = sampling

sample = true|false

sampling_strategy (head|tail|error_only|workflow_priority)

rationale

3.5 Integration Health Decision

integration_decision_id

decision_type = integration_health

integration_id

status (healthy|degraded|down)

signals (metrics/events)

recommended_mode (normal|degraded|pause_noncritical)

rationale

3.6 Evidence Completeness Decision

evidence_decision_id

decision_type = evidence_completeness

bundle_id

complete = true|false

missing_requirements[]

integrity_ok = true|false

rationale

4. Decision Rules (Deterministic Baselines)

These are starter rules; tune over time.

4.1 Severity assignment rule (starter)

Severity is a function of impact and confidence.

Impact signals:

percentage of traffic affected

critical workflow affected (payments, governance, identity)

data integrity risk

Confidence signals:

sustained duration

multiple corroborating signals (metric + logs + traces)

provider status confirmations

Suggested mapping

SEV0: system-wide outage or high-confidence security breach

SEV1: major outage of critical workflow or integration

SEV2: significant degradation, partial traffic

SEV3: localized or intermittent issue

SEV4: informational

4.2 SLO burn alert rule (starter)

Use fast/slow burn:

fast burn: pages quickly for severe degradation

slow burn: tickets / lower urgency for long-term erosion

Example:

page if burn rate > X for Y minutes

warn if burn rate > A for B hours

4.3 Dedupe/grouping rule

Group alerts when:

same service + environment + rule_id within time window

same integration_id + failure mode

same workflow_id or incident_signature

4.4 Suppression rule

Suppress when:

within declared maintenance window

incident already open for same signature

alert is flapping below stability threshold

Suppression must emit a suppression decision event.

4.5 Auto-incident creation rule

Create incident when:

SEV0 or SEV1 alert triggers

OR N distinct services degraded simultaneously

OR critical integration status becomes down

Link to existing incident when:

matching signature and open incident exists

4.6 Evidence completeness rule

Bundle is ready_to_seal when:

all required artifacts present (per GGP references)

integrity verified (hash/signature)

final execution outcome recorded

5. Decision Lifecycle

All LUM decisions follow the same lifecycle.

States

evaluating

decided

executed (action taken: alert sent, incident created, route applied)

revised (decision updated due to new information)

expired (no longer applicable)

Rules

decisions are immutable as records; revisions create a new decision referencing prior decision id

every decision emits an event to the LUM events pipeline

6. Explainability Requirements

Every decision must produce:

rationale: why the decision happened

inputs: which signals were used (refs)

rules: which rule ids applied

correlation: trace/workflow/decision/integration ids

Explainability is surfaced in:

alert details

incident timeline

sampling/routing debug views

7. Interlock with GGP

LUM emits signals that can inform governance but does not govern.

7.1 Signals LUM can send to GGP

“error budget exhausted for critical workflow”

“integration degraded: recommend pause noncritical actions”

“evidence bundle incomplete past SLA”

“suspicious access pattern detected”

7.2 Governance decisions remain in GGP

gating actions based on reliability state

granting evidence access

altering retention requirements

8. Audit & Storage

All LUM decisions are stored as:

decision records (structured)

decision events (append-only)

linked to affected alerts/incidents/bundles

Minimum indexing keys

decision_type

service / source_engine

integration_id

workflow_id

trace_id

incident_id

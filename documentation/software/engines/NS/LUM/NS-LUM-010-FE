NS-LUM-010 — FE (Operator UI)

0. Overview

This document defines the optional Front-End (FE) Operator UI for LUM (Luminance Engine).

The LUM UI is the operational cockpit for:

system and integration health

alert triage and routing

incident response and timelines

trace exploration and correlation

evidence bundle viewing (policy-controlled)

This UI does not replace GGP approval workflows; it surfaces governance references (decision_id) and enforces access rules.

1. User Roles & Access

1.1 Roles (conceptual)

Operator: triage alerts, view dashboards, create incidents

Incident Commander (IC): manage incidents, assign mitigations

Engineer/Responder: deep trace/log inspection for assigned services

Auditor/Reviewer: view evidence bundles and access logs (time-boxed, GGP-authorized)

Admin: manage routing policies, SLO definitions, integrations (as allowed)

1.2 Access model

Identity: via IDN

Authorization: via GGP decisions/policies

Evidence access: always requires a decision_id authorizing access

2. Core UI Areas

2.1 Home Dashboard

Purpose: one-glance system health.

Widgets

overall health summary (green/yellow/red)

open incidents by severity

open alerts by severity

key SLO burn indicators

top degraded integrations

Primary interactions

click into Incident Console

click into Alerts Inbox

quick search by correlation ID

2.2 Alerts Inbox

Purpose: triage and route alerts.

Table columns

severity

alert summary

service / engine

environment

first triggered / last updated

group key / dedupe

status (open/acked/resolved)

linked incident

Actions

ack / unack

suppress (time-boxed)

escalate

create/link incident

open correlation view (workflow_id/trace_id)

Required explainability

show: rule_id + version, condition, rationale, top signals

2.3 Incident Console

Purpose: run incident response.

Incident page sections

header: title, severity, status, owner IC

impact summary

timeline (auto + manual entries)

linked alerts

correlated traces/logs/events

mitigation actions list

runbook attachment

communications notes

closure checklist

Actions

change state (triaging → mitigating → monitoring → resolved)

add timeline note

add mitigation action

generate postmortem draft packet

export action items to CWP

2.4 Trace Explorer

Purpose: follow execution end-to-end.

Core features

search by trace_id, workflow_id, request_id, decision_id

service map (spans by service)

waterfall view (spans timeline)

error span highlighting

attributes viewer (redacted)

Shortcuts

“show logs for selected span”

“show events correlated to this trace”

2.5 Correlation View (the “single pane of glass”)

Purpose: stitch all signal types into a single narrative.

Inputs (any)

workflow_id

decision_id

integration_id

entity_id (policy controlled)

Outputs

ordered event stream

associated traces

top logs and errors

metrics for the timeframe

evidence bundle link (if any)

2.6 Integration Health

Purpose: monitor external providers (Coinbase, Maps, etc.).

Integration page sections

status (healthy/degraded/down)

request success rate

latency p95/p99

quota consumption (if available)

top error codes

webhook verification failures

retry and idempotency collision rates

Actions

open related incidents

open recent correlation views

emit “degraded mode advisory” event (informational)

2.7 SLO/SLI Studio

Purpose: define and manage SLIs/SLOs.

Features

list SLOs with status and burn-rate indicators

edit SLO targets/window (gated if it impacts automation)

view historical attainment

map SLOs to alert policies

2.8 Alert Policy & Routing Manager

Purpose: manage alert rules and routing.

Features

policy list with versions

staging vs enabled

preview/test against historical telemetry

dedupe key templates

routing rules and escalation steps

suppression rules with audit logs

2.9 Evidence Viewer (Policy-Controlled)

Purpose: browse evidence bundles and artifacts.

Requirements

show access authorization decision_id

immutable view for sealed bundles

artifact integrity hashes

chain-of-custody: access log

Views

bundle overview: type, decision_id, workflow_id, sealed_at

artifact list with storage refs and hashes

audit events list

access log list (who/when/purpose)

Actions

request access (creates a GGP decision request)

export bundle summary (redacted)

2.10 Search

Purpose: fast navigation.

Search keys

trace_id

workflow_id

decision_id

incident_id

alert_id

integration_id

entity_id (only if authorized)

3. Global UI Conventions

3.1 Severity design

SEV0/SEV1 visually dominant

SEV2/SEV3 reduced emphasis

SEV4 informational

3.2 Explainability everywhere

Every alert/incident page must show:

what triggered

which rule/version

which signals supported the decision

correlation IDs

3.3 Time controls

global time range selector

“jump to incident window” button

timezone display

3.4 Redaction UX

sensitive fields masked by default

reveal requires explicit access decision

all reveals logged

4. Primary Navigation (Suggested)

Home

Alerts

Incidents

Traces

Correlation

Integrations

SLOs

Policies

Evidence

Admin

5. MVP UI Scope

MVP should ship:

Home Dashboard

Alerts Inbox

Incident Console

Correlation View (by workflow_id)

Integration Health (Coinbase + Maps)

Defer to v1:

SLO studio

Policy manager preview/testing

Full evidence viewer workflows

6. Security & Audit Requirements

all UI actions emit audit logs (viewed evidence, suppressed alert, changed routing)

evidence screens require authorization decision references

role-based feature visibility enforced by IDN + GGP

7. UX Notes (Operator Ergonomics)

minimize clicks: one-click “create incident”

incident timeline autogenerates as much as possible

deep links: shareable URLs for trace/workflow/incident

quick filters: service, environment, severity, integration

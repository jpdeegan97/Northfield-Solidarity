NS-IPR-002 — TAXONOMY

This document defines the vocabulary NS-IPR uses to classify IP assets, capture evidence, manage ownership, and track filing workflows.

The goal: every IP record is consistent, searchable, and routable into GGE / quickscope / AEGIS / DRE.

1) Core objects

NS-IPR standardizes these primary objects:

IPAsset — the canonical registry record

EvidenceItem — proof of creation/invention/use

OwnershipChain — who owns it and how title is established

Contributor — people/entities who created or contributed

Agreement — assignment/contract documents governing ownership

Filing — a registration effort (trademark/copyright/patent)

DocketItem — a deadline, renewal, or action item

RiskFlag — a risk signal (missing assignment, collision, disclosure risk)

Decision — protect vs publish vs keep secret, with rationale (routes to GGE)

2) IP asset taxonomy

2.1 Asset classes

Trademark

Copyright

Patent

TradeSecret

Brand (pre-filing brand candidates)

Design (UI/UX, visual design elements)

Dataset (data assets)

KnowHow (processes, internal systems)

2.2 Asset types (more specific)

Trademark-related

word_mark

logo_mark

slogan

product_line

domain

Copyright-related

source_code

documentation

creative_content

ui_assets

Patent-related

system

method

workflow

algorithm

hardware_integration

Trade secret-related

process

configuration

operational_playbook

model_or_prompting_strategy

dataset_recipe

2.3 Confidentiality posture

public (already public)

internal (NS internal)

restricted (need-to-know)

trade_secret (explicitly managed as trade secret)

2.4 Protection intent

file_now

file_later

monitor

keep_secret

open_source

abandon

3) Evidence taxonomy (provenance)

Evidence is the backbone of defensibility.

3.1 Evidence categories

RepositoryEvidence

commit hash

tag/release

file hash

build artifact checksum

DocumentEvidence

spec/charter/standard doc IDs

meeting notes (if used)

PublicationEvidence

website page / marketing page

launch announcement

public docs

UseInCommerceEvidence (trademark critical)

invoices

screenshots

sales pages

app store listings

InventionDisclosureEvidence (patent)

invention disclosure form

diagrams

experiments

prototypes

AuthorshipEvidence

contributor claims

contractor statements

emails/approvals (references only)

3.2 Evidence strength (optional)

weak (informal note)

medium (repo/doc reference)

strong (timestamped artifact + hash + controlled access)

legal_grade (counsel-ready, organized, auditable)

4) Ownership and contributor taxonomy

4.1 Owner entity types

individual (employee/founder)

company (Northfield Solidarity LLC or subsidiaries)

contractor_entity

third_party

4.2 Contributor roles

author

co_author

inventor

designer

reviewer

implementer

4.3 Chain of title states

clear (assignments complete)

incomplete (missing agreement/signature)

disputed (conflict)

third_party_owned (licensed/used)

5) Agreement taxonomy

Agreements are how you prove ownership.

5.1 Agreement types

employee_invention_assignment

contractor_ip_assignment

nda

work_for_hire

license_in

license_out

contributor_license_agreement (CLA)

5.2 Agreement status

draft

sent

signed

expired

superseded

6) Filing taxonomy

6.1 Filing types

TrademarkFiling

CopyrightFiling

PatentFiling

6.2 Filing jurisdictions

us (USPTO / US Copyright Office)

eu

uk

ca

au

global_strategy (placeholder for multi-jurisdiction planning)

6.3 Filing status (generic)

candidate

researching

ready_for_counsel

filed

office_action

responded

allowed

registered/granted

rejected/abandoned

renewal_due

renewed

6.4 Trademark-specific concepts

Nice Class (goods/services classification)

Specimen (proof of use)

First use / use in commerce dates

Watch (monitor confusingly similar marks)

6.5 Patent-specific concepts

provisional

non_provisional

priority_date

public_disclosure_risk

prior_art

inventor_list

7) Risk flag taxonomy

NS-IPR uses risk flags to force action.

7.1 Risk categories

missing_assignment

unclear_ownership

third_party_license_risk

open_source_contamination

brand_collision

public_disclosure_risk

confidentiality_breach_risk

missed_deadline_risk

specimen_insufficient

inventor_dispute_risk

7.2 Risk severity

low|medium|high|critical

7.3 Risk resolution state

open

mitigating

resolved

accepted

8) State machine taxonomy (quickscope routing)

8.1 Asset lifecycle states

intake

classified

evidence_ready

ownership_ready

decision_pending

filing_in_progress

registered

maintaining

retired

8.2 Docket lifecycle states

scheduled

due_soon

overdue

completed

waived

9) Integration tagging (engine routing keys)

Every IPAsset record should carry:

Project (e.g., NS-AEGIS, NS-PG, NS-LUM)

AssetClass

ConfidentialityPosture

ProtectionIntent

Jurisdiction (if applicable)

Routing defaults:

Decisions → GGE

Filing/Docket tasks → quickscope

OSS/license risk flags → NS-AEGIS

Research/prior art threads → DRE

NS-IPR-003 — ARCHITECTURE

NS-IPR is an internal IP operations engine. Its architecture is designed to: (1) capture provenance early, (2) enforce ownership clarity, (3) gate disclosure, (4) package counsel-ready filing materials, and (5) never miss deadlines.

1) Architectural principles

Archive-first, audit-ready: the source of truth is your IP registry + evidence store.

Evidence before filing: every action is anchored to provenance artifacts.

Decision gates: “protect vs publish vs keep secret” is explicit and recorded.

Workflow over magic: automate only after the process is stable.

Least disclosure: avoid public release before patent/trade-secret decisions.

Integrate, don’t replace: NS-IPR routes to quickscope/GGE/AEGIS/DRE rather than duplicating them.

2) Core components

2.1 Intake Layer

Purpose: capture new IP candidates as they emerge.

Intake sources:

New repos, packages, or major modules

New product/engine names, logos, slogans

New standards/docs/diagrams

New datasets or data pipelines

Novel system architectures or algorithms

Outputs:

A new IPAsset record in intake state

Initial metadata: project tag, asset class guess, confidentiality posture

2.2 Registry Layer (Canonical Inventory)

Purpose: a single source of truth of what exists.

Stores:

IPAssets (all tracked items)

Filing records and statuses

Ownership chains

Risk flags

Links to evidence and agreements

Registry requirements:

searchable by project, asset class, name/mark, repo path, decision, filing status

stable IDs for cross-linking

2.3 Evidence Layer (Provenance + Proof)

Purpose: defensibility and counsel-ready packaging.

Evidence inputs:

repo commit hashes, tags, file hashes

doc IDs + versions

screenshots/specimens (trademark use)

invention disclosures (patent)

publication references (what was made public and when)

Evidence outputs:

Evidence Pack per asset

Evidence strength grading (weak → legal-grade)

2.4 Ownership & Assignment Layer

Purpose: chain of title clarity.

Inputs:

contributor list (employees/contractors)

agreements (assignment/CLA/NDA/license)

entity structure mapping (who owns what LLC)

Outputs:

Ownership Pack per asset

Risk flags when chain is incomplete

2.5 Decision Gate Layer

Purpose: make protection posture explicit.

Key decisions:

protect type: trademark / copyright / patent / trade secret

timeline: file now vs later

disclosure: publish now vs delay

open source posture (requires AEGIS alignment)

Decision outputs:

Decision records routed to GGE

Updates to the asset’s protection intent + workflow state

2.6 Filing Pack Layer

Purpose: produce counsel-ready handoff.

Per filing type, produce standardized packs:

Trademark Pack: mark, owner, goods/services classes, specimen candidates, use dates, search notes

Copyright Pack: work description, authorship, publication status, deposit materials

Patent Pack: invention disclosure, claims sketch, diagrams, inventor list, priority timing, disclosure risk notes

Output:

ready_for_counsel filing record + pack bundle

2.7 Docketing & Maintenance Layer

Purpose: never miss deadlines.

Tracks:

filing deadlines

office action response windows

renewals/maintenance

watch/monitor actions (e.g., confusingly similar marks)

Outputs:

Docket items routed to quickscope

Escalation rules for overdue / critical deadlines

2.8 Risk Engine

Purpose: continuously surface hazards.

Risk inputs:

missing assignments

OSS/license conflicts (from NS-AEGIS)

brand collisions (internal + external search results)

disclosure events (site publish, repo public, marketing announcements)

Risk outputs:

Risk flags on assets

Required mitigations as quickscope tasks

3) Data stores (conceptual)

NS-IPR is intentionally storage-agnostic, but conceptually needs:

IP Registry Store

structured records (assets, filings, decisions, docket)

Evidence Store

immutable-ish artifact storage (hashes + files + references)

Agreement Store

signed PDFs and metadata (references only in Chronicle)

Index/Search (optional but recommended)

fast search across assets, marks, classes, dates

4) Integration architecture (Northfield Solidarity)

4.1 quickscope (Intervention)

Routes:

docket items (deadlines)

mitigation tasks (risk flags)

“next actions” for filing workflows

4.2 GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Routes:

protect/publish decisions

OSS policy decisions

brand naming approvals

4.3 NS-AEGIS

Routes:

OSS dependency/license posture and conflicts

alerts when a repo’s license posture threatens “owned IP” claims

4.4 DRE

Routes:

invention threads

prior art research notes and source links

4.5 NS-INC / NS-CHRONICLE

Consumes:

project artifacts (docs/code) as evidence

daily/weekly records for provenance timeline

5) Operational flows (at a glance)

5.1 New engine/project name

Intake → Brand candidate → Collision search → Decision gate → Trademark pack → Docket

5.2 New core repo/module

Intake → Evidence pack (repo metadata) → Ownership check → Decision gate (copyright/trade secret/patent) → Filing pack (if applicable)

5.3 Patent-sensitive invention

Intake → Confidentiality posture restricted → Evidence pack → Invention disclosure → Decision gate (file provisional?) → Counsel handoff → Publication allowed only after gate

6) Adoption tiers

Tier A — Manual (MVP)

Manual registry entries

Manual evidence bundle creation

quickscope used for deadlines

Tier B — Semi-automated

Auto-extract repo metadata + hashes

Standard pack templates

Automated docket reminders

Tier C — Engine-integrated

Detection of new assets from NS-INC/CHRONICLE and repos

AEGIS-driven risk ingestion

GGE decision routing

Full state machine + analytics

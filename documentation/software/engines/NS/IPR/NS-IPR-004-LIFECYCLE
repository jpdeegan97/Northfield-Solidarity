NS-IPR-004 — LIFECYCLE

This document defines the end-to-end lifecycle NS-IPR enforces: from IP intake → evidence → ownership → decision gates → filing workflow → maintenance.

NS-IPR’s lifecycle is designed to prevent three common IP failures:

weak provenance (can’t prove what existed when)

unclear ownership (missing assignments / chain of title)

bad timing (public disclosure before patent strategy; missed filing/renewal deadlines)

1) Lifecycle overview (the spine)

NS-IPR runs a standard flow for every IPAsset:

Intake

Classification

Evidence Pack

Ownership Pack

Decision Gate

Filing Pack + Counsel Handoff (if applicable)

Docketing + Maintenance

Audit + Updates (continuous)

At any step, NS-IPR may open Risk Flags and route tasks into quickscope.

2) States (canonical)

Every IPAsset lives in exactly one lifecycle state at a time:

intake

classified

evidence_ready

ownership_ready

decision_pending

filing_in_progress

registered (or granted for patents)

maintaining

retired

A Filing record has its own status set (candidate → filed → office action → registered, etc.), but the IPAsset state remains the single “top-level truth.”

3) Phase 1 — Intake

3.1 Goal

Ensure nothing valuable is “born untracked.”

3.2 Triggers

new repo/module, major feature, or algorithm

new engine/product name, logo, slogan, domain

new doc/spec/standard that represents novel work

new dataset/data pipeline recipes

new internal process that might be a trade secret

3.3 Required inputs

Project tag (e.g., NS-AEGIS, NS-PG)

Asset title/name

Initial confidentiality posture (public|internal|restricted|trade_secret)

3.4 Outputs

IPAsset created with state: intake

Initial “owner candidate” entity (best guess; verified later)

quickscope tasks opened if any obvious gaps exist

3.5 Definition of Done

IPAsset exists in registry with minimal metadata

4) Phase 2 — Classification

4.1 Goal

Identify what type of protection is relevant.

4.2 Actions

assign AssetClass and AssetType

set ProtectionIntent (file now / later / monitor / keep secret / open source / abandon)

identify whether disclosure is currently safe

4.3 Outputs

IPAsset updated to state: classified

Risk flags opened if:

public disclosure risk exists

brand collision likely

OSS/license posture may contaminate claims

4.4 Definition of Done

Classification is explicit and recorded

5) Phase 3 — Evidence Pack

5.1 Goal

Create defensible provenance.

5.2 Evidence capture (examples)

repo commits/tags, file hashes

doc IDs + versions

prototypes, diagrams

trademark “use in commerce” specimens

publication timestamps (if already public)

5.3 Outputs

EvidencePack attached to the asset

Evidence strength grading (optional)

5.4 Definition of Done

EvidencePack exists and is linked

For high-value assets: evidence must be at least strong

6) Phase 4 — Ownership Pack (chain of title)

6.1 Goal

Prove who owns it (and that they can file).

6.2 Actions

identify all contributors (authors/inventors/designers)

map contributors to agreements (employee assignment, contractor assignment, NDA/CLA)

map owner entity (which NS LLC holds this)

6.3 Outputs

OwnershipPack attached

Chain-of-title state:

clear / incomplete / disputed / third_party_owned

6.4 Definition of Done

Chain-of-title is clear OR the asset is blocked with a critical risk flag

Hard gate:

Do not file or publish as “owned IP” if chain-of-title is incomplete.

7) Phase 5 — Decision Gate

7.1 Goal

Make protect/publish posture explicit (and auditable).

7.2 Decision types

trademark: proceed? which classes? which mark variants?

patent: file provisional? timeline? disclosure posture?

trade secret: keep restricted? controls required?

open source: allowed? license? what must be removed?

7.3 Outputs

Decision record routed to GGE

IPAsset moves to:

decision_pending (if not resolved)

or directly to filing_in_progress / maintaining depending on result

7.4 Definition of Done

A decision is “made” only if it has:

Choice

Rationale

linked evidence/ownership packs

8) Phase 6 — Filing Pack + Counsel Handoff

8.1 Goal

Produce a counsel-ready package quickly and consistently.

8.2 Filing pack outputs (by type)

Trademark Pack

mark, owner, goods/services classes, specimen candidates, use dates, collision notes

Copyright Pack

work description, authorship, publication status, deposit materials list

Patent Pack

invention disclosure, diagrams, claims sketch, inventor list, priority timing, disclosure risk

8.3 Workflow

filing record created: ready_for_counsel

counsel handoff happens (external)

filing status is tracked inside NS-IPR

8.4 Definition of Done

filing pack exists and is linked

docket items are created (deadlines, office actions, renewals)

9) Phase 7 — Docketing + Maintenance

9.1 Goal

Never miss a deadline; keep registrations alive.

9.2 Docket items

office action response windows

statements of use / specimens

renewals / maintenance fees

watch/monitor actions

9.3 Routing

docket items → quickscope

critical deadlines → escalation policy (see NS-IPR-013)

9.4 Definition of Done

All deadlines are represented as docket items

Overdue/critical escalation is active

10) Phase 8 — Audit + Continuous updates

10.1 Goal

Keep registry current and provable.

Ongoing actions:

update filing statuses

attach new evidence (e.g., new specimens, new releases)

update ownership when entity structure changes

record reversals or strategic changes as GGE decisions

Definition of Done:

registry reflects current truth; no “unknown status” for Tier 0/1 assets

11) Gates (the non-negotiables)

Gate A — Disclosure gate (patent/trade secret)

If an asset is patent-sensitive or trade-secret-managed:

default to restricted

no public release until decision gate passes

Gate B — Ownership gate

No filing or “owned IP” claims without a clear chain of title.

Gate C — Evidence gate

No major filing without an evidence pack.

Gate D — Deadline gate

Every filing creates docket items immediately.

12) Tiering (what gets the most rigor)

NS-IPR should classify assets into tiers (informal v1):

Tier 0 IP: existential brands, core platform inventions

Tier 1 IP: major product lines, foundational standards

Tier 2 IP: useful but replaceable

Tier 3 IP: low value / exploratory

Tier affects:

evidence strength requirements

counsel involvement

docket escalation severity

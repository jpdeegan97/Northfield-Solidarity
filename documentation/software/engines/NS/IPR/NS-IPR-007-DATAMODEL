NS-IPR-007 — DATAMODEL

This document defines the canonical NS-IPR data model: entities, relationships, identity rules, and engine mappings.

NS-IPR’s model is designed to support:

audit-grade provenance

chain-of-title clarity

filing/docket workflows

risk surfacing

routing into GGE / quickscope / AEGIS / DRE

1) Core entities

1.1 IPAsset (the canonical unit)

Represents one protectable “thing” you care about.

Examples:

the mark “Northfield Solidarity” (word mark)

the engine name “NS-AEGIS”

application_number (optional)

registration_number (optional)

filed_date (optional)

priority_date (patent)

nice_classes[] (trademark)

specimen_refs[] (trademark)

counsel_ref (optional)

Relationships:

1.8 FilingPack

Counsel-ready bundle for one filing effort.

Key fields:

pack_id

filing_id

pack_type (TrademarkPack/CopyrightPack/PatentPack)

pack_version

contents_refs[] (evidence, diagrams, descriptions)

1.9 DocketItem

A tracked deadline/action.

Key fields:

docket_id

asset_id (and/or filing_id)

docket_type (office_action_response, renewal, specimen_due, maintenance_fee, watch_check)

due_date

severity (low/medium/high/critical)

state (scheduled/due_soon/overdue/completed/waived)

next_action

owner (who is responsible)

1.10 RiskFlag

A risk signal that requires mitigation.

Key fields:

risk_id

state (open/mitigating/resolved/accepted)

description

mitigation_plan

links[]

1.11 Decision

A recorded governance choice for the asset.

asset_id

project

decision_class (naming/legal/security/product/etc.)

status (draft/made/reversed)

choice

rationale

consequences

effective_date

evidence_links[]

reversal_of_decision_id (optional)

2) Relationships (graph view)

Canonical edges:

IPAsset → EvidenceItem (HAS_EVIDENCE)

IPAsset → OwnershipChain (HAS_OWNERSHIP)

OwnershipChain → Agreement (GOVERNED_BY)

OwnershipChain → Contributor (CONTRIBUTED_BY)

IPAsset → Filing (HAS_FILING)

Filing → FilingPack (HAS_PACK)

Filing → DocketItem (HAS_DOCKET)

IPAsset → RiskFlag (HAS_RISK)

IPAsset → Decision (HAS_DECISION)

Cross-engine edges:

Decision → GGE (EMITTED_TO)

DocketItem/RiskFlag tasks → quickscope (EMITTED_TO)

OSS-related RiskFlag → NS-AEGIS (EMITTED_TO)

Prior-art/research EvidenceItem → DRE (EMITTED_TO)

3) Identity rules (stable IDs)

NS-IPR requires stable IDs to keep provenance auditable.

3.1 Recommended ID formats

asset_id = IPR-ASSET::<project>::<slug>

filing_id = IPR-FILING::<asset_id>::<jurisdiction>::<type>::<n>

docket_id = IPR-DOCKET::<filing_id>::<due_date>::<type>

risk_id = IPR-RISK::<asset_id>::<category>::<n>

decision_id = IPR-DEC::<asset_id>::<date>::<slug>

Slug rules:

lowercase

hyphen separated

deterministic from title/mark where possible

4) State model (top-level)

4.1 IPAsset lifecycle state

intake

classified

evidence_ready

ownership_ready

decision_pending

filing_in_progress

registered

maintaining

retired

4.2 Filing status

See NS-IPR-002; Filing has its own status independent of IPAsset.

4.3 Docket state

scheduled | due_soon | overdue | completed | waived

4.4 Risk state

open | mitigating | resolved | accepted

5) Engine mappings

5.1 quickscope (Intervention)

Emit tasks/events for:

every DocketItem

every RiskFlag with severity >= high

filing pack preparation tasks

quickscope fields:

title, next_action, due_date, severity, links, asset_id, project

5.2 GGE (Governance Graph Engine)

Emit governance records for:

protect/publish posture decisions

naming approvals

OSS posture decisions

entity ownership placement decisions

GGE fields:

decision_id, asset_id, choice, rationale, effective_date, evidence_links

5.3 NS-AEGIS

Emit/consume for OSS risk:

RiskFlags of category open_source_contamination or third_party_license_risk

link to repo/module and dependency graph context

5.4 DRE

Emit research nodes for:

prior art notes

invention threads

sources (EvidenceItems with external URLs)

6) Minimal “registry MVP” record set

To be useful immediately, every IPAsset should minimally have:

asset_id

project

title

asset_class

confidentiality_posture

protection_intent

lifecycle_state

at least one EvidenceItem reference

an OwnershipChain state (clear or incomplete)

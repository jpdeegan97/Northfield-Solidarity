NS-IPR-000 — CHARTER (IP Formalization + Registration Engine)

1) Mission

Build an internal engine that turns Northfield Solidarity’s IP into formal, defensible, and searchable assets by:

capturing invention/creation evidence

standardizing ownership + assignment

managing filing workflows (copyright, trademark, patent strategy)

producing audit-ready provenance and status

This engine exists to make “IP lockdown” operational and repeatable.

2) Problem statement

As NS creates many artifacts (engines, docs, code, brands, datasets, designs), IP risk increases:

unclear ownership/assignment

inconsistent marking and evidence

missed filing windows

trademark collisions

accidental open-source leakage

inability to prove invention dates or authorship

NS-IPR solves this by creating a single IP pipeline from creation → classification → decision → registration → maintenance.

3) Scope

In scope

IP intake workflow for everything created at NS (code, docs, brand, designs)

IP asset registry (canonical inventory)

Evidence capture + provenance

Ownership + assignment management (entity/employee/contractor)

Filing workflow tracking:

trademarks

copyrights

patents (strategy + docketing)

Open-source and third-party dependency policy hooks (NS-AEGIS alignment)

Renewal/maintenance calendar (deadlines, fees, watch-outs)

Out of scope (initially)

Acting as a law firm or replacing counsel

Automatically filing with governments (we track + package; counsel/files externally)

Litigation management

4) Primary users

Founder/operator (you)

Legal ops (future)

Engineering leads (future)

Brand/product owners (future)

5) Core principles

Evidence-first: every asset has a provenance trail.

Default protect: treat novel work as protectable until decided otherwise.

Separation of concerns: create → classify → decide → file → maintain.

Least disclosure: don’t publish before decisions on patent/trade secret posture.

Auditability: you can answer “who created what, when, under what assignment, and what’s its legal status?”

6) IP classes supported

Trademark: names, logos, slogans, product lines

Copyright: code, docs, creative works

Patent: inventions, methods, systems (provisional → non-provisional strategy)

Trade secret: non-public know-how, processes, datasets, configs

Contracts/Assignments: contributor agreements, contractor IP assignment, invention assignment

7) Engine outputs (deliverables)

NS-IPR produces:

IP Asset Record (canonical registry entry)

Evidence Pack (source files, hashes, timestamps, commit refs, author claims)

Ownership Pack (assignment chain, entity mapping, contributor agreements)

Filing Pack (draft descriptions, classes, specimens, priority dates, counsel handoff)

Maintenance Pack (renewal schedule, reminders, watch service links)

Risk Flags (collisions, missing assignments, OSS conflicts, public disclosure risk)

8) Interfaces with other NS engines/projects

GGE: governance policies (IP policy, OSS policy), decision logs

NS-AEGIS: dependency and license compliance signals (OSS exposure risk)

DRE: research provenance and invention threads

quickscope: state tracking for filings, tasks, deadlines

NS-CHRONICLE / NS-INC: daily/weekly iteration artifacts that create IP evidence trails

9) Success metrics

100% of projects have an IP asset record for names + core repos

100% of contributors have signed assignment terms before substantial work

No missed renewal/maintenance deadlines

Time to produce a filing handoff pack ≤ 1 hour

Reduction in “unknown ownership” or “untracked brand usage” to near zero

10) Risks and mitigations

Overhead creep: keep intake lightweight; automate hashing + metadata later.

False confidence: use counsel review gates for filing decisions.

Over-filing: introduce decision criteria so filings are strategic.

Disclosure risk: patent/trade secret gates before publishing.

11) Roadmap (high-level)

Phase 1 — Registry + Intake (MVP)

Asset taxonomy + registry

Contributor/assignment checklist

Evidence capture baseline (repo refs + hashes)

Phase 2 — Filing workflow + packs

Trademark/copyright/patent pack templates

Docketing + deadline tracking

Phase 3 — Automation + integrations

AEGIS license risk ingestion

quickscope state machine for filings

LUM visibility for deadline health

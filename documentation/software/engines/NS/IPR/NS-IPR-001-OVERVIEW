NS-IPR-001 — OVERVIEW

1) What NS-IPR is

NS-IPR is Northfield Solidarity’s IP Formalization + Registration Engine: a repeatable pipeline that turns what you create (code, docs, brand, systems, designs, datasets) into formal, defensible, searchable IP assets.

It is not a law firm. It is an operational system that:

captures invention/creation evidence

standardizes ownership and assignment

manages filing workflows and deadlines

produces counsel-ready “filing packs”

maintains a living IP registry

2) The problem NS-IPR solves

Without a system, IP effort becomes reactive and error-prone:

unclear ownership or missing assignments

weak provenance (hard to prove dates/authorship)

missed trademark/patent timing windows

accidental public disclosures

brand collisions and inconsistent usage

OSS and third-party license exposure that contaminates “owned IP”

NS-IPR makes IP protection a normal part of shipping, not a one-off legal scramble.

3) The NS-IPR pipeline (end-to-end)

NS-IPR runs a consistent flow:

Create (work happens in repos/docs/design)

Intake (asset is logged; minimal metadata captured)

Classify (what type of IP is this?)

Evidence Pack (provenance: commits, hashes, timestamps, authors, artifacts)

Ownership Pack (entity ownership + contributor assignment chain)

Decision Gate (protect as trademark/copyright/patent/trade secret/OSS?)

Filing Pack (counsel-ready materials and docket)

Maintenance (renewals, specimens, monitoring, deadlines)

Audit + Search (registry always current)

4) Primary outputs

NS-IPR outputs a set of durable artifacts:

IP Asset Record (canonical registry entry)

Evidence Pack (what existed, when, who, where)

Ownership/Assignment Pack (chain of title)

Filing Pack (trademark/copyright/patent handoff)

Maintenance Pack (renewal calendar + watchpoints)

Risk Flags (missing assignments, OSS license conflicts, disclosure risk)

5) IP classes supported

NS-IPR supports:

Trademarks: product/engine names, logos, slogans

Copyright: code, docs, creative content

Patents: systems/methods (provisional → non-provisional strategy)

Trade secrets: internal processes, data, techniques not publicly disclosed

Contracts/Assignments: invention assignment, contractor IP assignment, contributor agreements

6) How NS-IPR fits into Northfield Solidarity

NS-IPR is a cross-cutting engine that interfaces with:

GGE: IP governance policies, decision logs, approvals

NS-AEGIS: OSS/dependency license posture (contamination risk)

DRE: invention threads, research provenance, prior art notes

quickscope: state tracking (filing status, deadlines, tasks)

NS-INC / NS-CHRONICLE: daily/weekly iteration artifacts that act as evidence trails

NS-LUM: deadline health + operational visibility (optional)

7) Adoption modes

Mode A — Manual (MVP)

You create IP asset records and evidence packs manually

Counsel filings tracked via checklists and deadlines

Mode B — Semi-automated

Hashing + metadata extraction from repos/docs

Deadline docketing + reminders

Standard filing pack templates

Mode C — Engine-integrated

Automatic detection of new assets (new repos, new project names, new brands)

AEGIS-driven OSS risk flags

quickscope state machine for filings/renewals

GGE decision routing for “protect vs publish”

8) Success indicators

Every core NS project has a registered/tracked name and repository ownership record

100% of contributors have assignments on file before meaningful contribution

No missed renewal or docket deadlines

Filing packs can be generated quickly (≤ 1 hour)

Clear answers to: “Who owns it, what is it, what’s filed, and what’s next?”

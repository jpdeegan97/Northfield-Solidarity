NS-IPR-006 — VERSION

This document defines how NS-IPR evolves over time without breaking your registry, evidence packs, integrations, or historical provenance.

NS-IPR has three versioning surfaces:

Registry schema version (records for assets/filings/docket/decisions)

Pack template version (Evidence/Ownership/Filing/Maintenance pack formats)

State machine version (workflow states and transitions)

1) Versioning goals

Preserve auditability across years.

Avoid breaking historical records.

Enable additive improvements without refactoring the archive.

Keep integrations (quickscope/GGE/AEGIS/DRE) stable.

2) Version identifiers

2.1 Registry schema version

Each IPAsset record must include:

schema_version (e.g., 1.0)

2.2 Pack template versions

Each pack includes:

pack_type (EvidencePack, OwnershipPack, TrademarkPack, PatentPack, etc.)

pack_version (e.g., 1.0)

2.3 State machine version

The lifecycle engine (even if manual) has:

workflow_version (e.g., 1.0)

3) Versioning scheme

NS-IPR uses a semantic approach:

MAJOR.MINOR

3.1 MINOR changes (backward compatible)

Allowed without breaking consumers:

adding optional fields

adding new enum values (with fallbacks)

adding new pack sections

adding new risk flags

3.2 MAJOR changes (breaking)

Require migration planning:

renaming fields

changing the meaning of an existing field

removing fields

changing identity rules for records

NS-IPR should aggressively avoid MAJOR changes.

4) Backward compatibility rules (non-negotiable)

4.1 Never delete history

Historical registry records and packs are immutable for audit purposes.

4.2 No silent renames

If you must rename a field:

introduce the new field

dual-write (populate both) for a transition window

update consumers to accept either

deprecate old field generation (but keep accepting it)

4.3 Unknown fields must be ignored

Consumers must ignore unknown fields and continue.

4.4 Unknown enums must degrade safely

If an enum value is unknown:

treat as unknown

preserve the raw string

optionally attach a warning

5) Deprecation policy

A field/enum/pack section can be deprecated when:

it’s redundant

it’s ambiguous

it creates operational risk

Deprecation means:

continue accepting it indefinitely

stop generating it in new packs after a transition

Deprecation does not require a MAJOR bump.

6) Migration policy

6.1 Migration triggers

Migrations may be required when:

registry shape changes materially

identity rules change (IDs)

workflow states change in incompatible ways

6.2 Migration principles

migrations must be idempotent

migration must never erase provenance

raw source artifacts remain the truth; derived indices can rebuild

7) Changelog requirements

Maintain:

NS-IPR/CHANGELOG.md

Every change includes:

date

version

what changed

consumer action required (yes/no)

deprecations

Suggested sections:

Added

Changed

Deprecated

Fixed

8) Current baseline versions (v1)

Registry schema: 1.0

EvidencePack: 1.0

OwnershipPack: 1.0

TrademarkPack: 1.0

CopyrightPack: 1.0

PatentPack: 1.0

MaintenancePack: 1.0

Workflow: 1.0

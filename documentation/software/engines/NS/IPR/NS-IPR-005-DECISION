NS-IPR-005 — DECISION

This document defines how NS-IPR makes, records, approves, routes, and (when necessary) reverses IP decisions across Northfield Solidarity.

NS-IPR decisions must be:

explicit (no “implicit posture”)

evidence-backed (linked to Evidence/Ownership packs)

auditable (who/when/why)

actionable (they create filing tasks, disclosure rules, or OSS actions)

1) Decision domains (what we decide)

NS-IPR decisions fall into these domains:

Protect posture

trademark / copyright / patent / trade secret / open source / abandon

Disclosure posture

publish now vs delay vs restricted

Jurisdiction strategy

US-only vs multi-jurisdiction (EU/UK/etc.)

Timing

file now vs file later vs monitor

Ownership/entity placement

which NS entity holds the asset

Brand controls

naming approvals, mark variants, usage standards

OSS posture (AEGIS alignment)

what can be open sourced, under what license, with what carve-outs

2) Non-negotiable gates

These gates must be satisfied before certain decisions can progress.

2.1 Ownership gate

If chain-of-title is not clear, no filing and no “owned IP” claims.

Action: open a quickscope task to complete assignments/agreements.

2.2 Evidence gate

High-value decisions require an Evidence Pack link.

At minimum: repo commit refs + doc refs + timestamps.

2.3 Disclosure gate (patent / trade secret)

If asset is patent-sensitive or trade-secret-managed, default is restricted.

Public disclosure requires an explicit decision and documented rationale.

2.4 OSS gate (license + contamination)

Open-source decisions require AEGIS posture review:

dependency licensing scan

inbound license restrictions

export of proprietary modules/keys/config

3) Decision criteria (how we choose)

3.1 Trademark decision criteria

Proceed when:

it’s a core name/brand used consistently

collision risk is acceptable

you can produce (or soon will) use in commerce evidence

you expect long-lived value

Delay/monitor when:

name may change

unclear product-market fit

insufficient specimen / usage maturity

3.2 Copyright decision criteria

Proceed when:

asset is a major body of code/docs/creative work

you want simplified enforcement posture

ownership is clear and deposit materials are available

Note: copyright exists automatically upon creation in many jurisdictions, but registration may be valuable for enforcement and formalization.

3.3 Patent decision criteria

Proceed when:

invention is novel and strategically defensible

it creates durable differentiation

disclosure timing is controllable

you can articulate claims and embodiments

Avoid/keep secret when:

invention is easily reverse-engineered (patent may be necessary)

OR when secrecy is maintainable and disclosure would weaken advantage

Key risk:

public disclosure before strategy can compromise patent options depending on jurisdiction.

3.4 Trade secret decision criteria

Proceed when:

value comes from non-public know-how

you can maintain controls (restricted access, NDAs, compartmentalization)

publication is not necessary for adoption

Trade secret requires operational discipline: access control + documentation + employee/contractor controls.

3.5 Open-source decision criteria (AEGIS-aligned)

Proceed when:

open source accelerates adoption/community

core differentiation remains protected (via patents, trade secrets, hosted services, or retained modules)

you can comply with inbound license constraints

Avoid when:

it exposes proprietary methods you plan to patent

it leaks trade secret material

it creates license obligations you cannot accept

4) Decision authority and approvals

Incubator-style rigor: authority depends on impact/tier.

4.1 Asset tiering (informal v1)

Tier 0: existential brand + core platform inventions

Tier 1: major product line assets

Tier 2: useful but replaceable

Tier 3: low-value / exploratory

4.2 Approval policy (default)

Tier 0/1 decisions require an explicit decision record and are treated as “high rigor.”

Patent/trade secret decisions always require the disclosure gate.

Trademark naming decisions for public-facing brands are treated as Tier 0/1 by default.

(As the org grows, approvals can be delegated to a legal ops role or governance council; for now this is “founder approval.”)

5) Decision outputs (what a decision must produce)

Every NS-IPR decision must produce:

A Decision Record (routes to GGE)

A State Transition for the IPAsset (routes to quickscope)

Concrete Next Actions (filing pack tasks, search tasks, agreement tasks)

Examples:

“File trademark” → create filing record + docket items + specimen work

“Keep as trade secret” → create controls checklist tasks (access restrictions)

“Open source under Apache-2.0” → AEGIS scan + repo license standardization + module separation tasks

6) Decision record format (canonical)

Decision records should be stored in the registry and emitted to GGE.

Minimum fields:

DecisionId

AssetId

Project

DecisionClass (naming|architecture|security|operations|product|finance|legal)

Choice

Rationale

Consequences

EffectiveDate

OwnerEntity

EvidenceLinks[]

OwnershipPackLink

RiskFlagsOpen[]

NextActions[]

Recommended: add ReversalOfDecisionId if reversing.

7) Reversals and changes

Decisions can change, but reversals must be explicit.

7.1 When reversals happen

name changes

OSS posture changes

filing abandoned

trade secret converted to patent filing

7.2 Reversal rules

never overwrite the original decision

create a new decision with status reversed or made + ReversalOfDecisionId

record what changed and why

update asset state and open new next actions

8) Routing rules (GGE + quickscope)

8.1 GGE routing (governance)

Send to GGE:

protect/publish posture

OSS posture decisions

naming approvals

entity ownership placements

GGE stores the “why” layer.

8.2 quickscope routing (state + tasks)

Send to quickscope:

filing workflow tasks

agreement completion tasks

docket items

disclosure controls tasks

quickscope stores the “what next” layer.

9) Decision checklists (operator quick-use)

9.1 Trademark decision checklist



9.2 Patent decision checklist



9.3 Trade secret decision checklist



9.4 Open-source decision checklist (AEGIS)

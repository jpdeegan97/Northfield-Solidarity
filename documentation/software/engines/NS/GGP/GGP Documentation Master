NS-GGP — Documentation Master Plan (Aligned to NS-GGP Canonical Template)

Purpose

This document defines the authoritative documentation master plan for the Governance Graph Processor (GGP), strictly aligned to the canonical NS engine document structure 000–014.

GGP is the governance nucleus of Northfield Solidarity. It defines, evaluates, and enforces governance rules over actions, capital flows, identity/roles, external integrations, and cross-engine workflows. It provides the decision logic, approvals, auditability requirements, and policy constraints that all engines must obey.

GGP is not:

A financial ledger (FLO)

An execution engine (DAT / CWP)

A pure analytics engine (DRE / PIE)

GGP is the policy + decision + enforcement plane that makes everything else compliant, intentional, and auditable.

GGP Documentation Index (Canonical)

NS-GGP-000 — CHARTER

Purpose: Define why GGP exists.

Scope:

Mission of GGP

What GGP governs (actions, capital, data, identities, integrations)

Core principles (least privilege, explicit approvals, auditability-by-design)

Engine boundaries (what GGP does NOT do)

NS-GGP-001 — OVERVIEW

Purpose: Provide an executive overview of how GGP operates.

Scope:

High-level decision lifecycle (request → evaluation → decision → enforcement → audit)

Primary artifacts (policies, decisions, controls, evidence)

Relationship to NS engines (FLO, IDN, CWP, MUX, SIG, LUM)

NS-GGP-002 — TAXONOMY

Purpose: Establish the canonical vocabulary for governance.

Scope:

Governance object taxonomy (Policy, Rule, Control, Constraint, Decision, Evidence)

Approval types (auto, single-approver, multi-sig, quorum)

Risk/materiality levels

Event types (decision events, enforcement events, audit events)

NS-GGP-003 — ARCHITECTURE

Purpose: Define the architecture of GGP and its integration surfaces.

Scope:

Core services/modules (Policy Store, Evaluator, Decision Service, Enforcement Gate)

External interfaces (API, webhook gate, policy evaluation endpoint)

Integrations with IDN (identity), FLO (ledger), LUM (telemetry), MUX/SIG/DRE

Deployment topology (where GGP lives, HA requirements)

NS-GGP-004 — LIFECYCLE

Purpose: Define the full lifecycle of governance artifacts and decisions.

Scope:

Policy lifecycle (draft → review → approval → publish → deprecate)

Decision lifecycle (request → evaluation → approval → enforce → close)

Evidence lifecycle (collect → retain → seal → expire)

Change management triggers and review cycles

NS-GGP-005 — DECISION

Purpose: Specify the formal decision model used by GGP.

Scope:

Decision graph concepts (nodes, edges, conditions)

Deterministic evaluation rules

Multi-signal inputs (risk, identity, limits, context)

Override/break-glass behavior (logged, time-bounded)

Decision outputs (allow/deny/require-approval/require-evidence)

NS-GGP-006 — VERSION

Purpose: Define versioning rules for policies, decision logic, and schema.

Scope:

Policy versioning (semantic or monotonic)

Compatibility rules (backwards/forwards)

Migration strategy for stored decisions

Deprecation policy and sunset windows

NS-GGP-007 — DATAMODEL

Purpose: Define the canonical GGP data model.

Scope:

Entities: Policy, Rule, Control, Decision, Approval, Evidence, Actor, Context

Relationships (graphs) and indexing strategy

Audit event schema requirements

Links to FLO ledger entries and IDN entity records

Storage approach (Postgres/Mongo/graph adjunct, if applicable)

NS-GGP-008 — EEE (End-to-End Example)

Purpose: Provide a full narrative example demonstrating GGP in action.

Scope:

Example: external payment webhook triggers fulfillment

Identity resolution (IDN), policy eval (GGP), ledger write (FLO), telemetry (LUM)

Decision + evidence bundle produced

Failure paths and governance responses

NS-GGP-009 — IMPL

Purpose: Define implementation guidance without locking into a single codebase.

Scope:

Service boundaries and API shapes

Policy language approach (DSL vs JSON rules)

Evaluation engine patterns (deterministic, testable)

Audit logging patterns, idempotency, replay safety

Testing strategy (policy unit tests, decision regression suites)

NS-GGP-010 — FE (Optional Operator UI)

Purpose: Define the optional UI for governance operators and approvers.

Scope:

Policy editor + review workflow

Approval inbox (queues, delegation)

Decision explorer (trace why a decision happened)

Evidence viewer (with access controls)

NS-GGP-011 — APIMAP

Purpose: Provide the authoritative map of GGP APIs.

Scope:

Decision evaluation endpoints

Policy CRUD endpoints

Approval endpoints (request/approve/deny/delegate)

Evidence submission and retrieval endpoints

Webhook-gate / external integration gate patterns

NS-GGP-012 — STATE

Purpose: Define GGP runtime states and state transitions.

Scope:

Decision states (pending, awaiting approval, allowed, denied, expired)

Policy states (draft, in-review, published, deprecated)

Approval states (requested, granted, denied, timed-out)

Evidence states (requested, received, sealed, invalid)

NS-GGP-013 — RUNBOOK

Purpose: Define operations, support, and incident procedures.

Scope:

On-call playbooks and troubleshooting

Common failure modes (auth, policy regression, outage)

Break-glass steps (with required evidence)

Restore procedures and integrity checks

NS-GGP-014 — DATADEF

Purpose: Define canonical field-level definitions and validation constraints.

Scope:

Field definitions for all core objects

Required/optional fields, enums, formats

Redaction rules and sensitive field classification

Cross-engine identifiers (entity_id, workflow_id, decision_id, integration_id)

Recommended Build Order (Practical)

000 CHARTER → 001 OVERVIEW → 002 TAXONOMY

005 DECISION → 012 STATE

007 DATAMODEL → 014 DATADEF

011 APIMAP → 003 ARCHITECTURE

004 LIFECYCLE → 006 VERSION

008 EEE → 009 IMPL

013 RUNBOOK → 010 FE (optional)

Ownership & Governance

GGP docs are authoritative; other engines must conform.

Any change that affects:

approval thresholds

capital/materiality limits

scope expansion for external APIs

evidence retention/access
requires a policy review and a new version per NS-GGP-006.

Open Items (Fill During Iteration)

Policy language selection (DSL vs JSON)

Evidence store approach (append-only stream + immutability controls)

Formal risk/materiality rubric

Default approval workflows per engine/action type

Overview
System Name: Governance Graph Engine (GGE) 
Document Name: Governance Graph Engine (GGE) - Overview Document
Document Id: NS-GGP-001-OVERVIEW

Review Cycle: Annual or Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
The Governance Graph Engine (GGE) is designed to serve as the central orchestration and automation platform for Northfield Solidarity’s governance framework.
Objectives:
  Automate the management, integration, and versioning of SOPs
  Maintain a living governance structure that is audit-ready and operationally consistent
  Ensure that updates to policies, materiality thresholds, authority matrices, or operational components are propagated systematically
  Provide a high-level decision-making engine that considers dependencies, escalation paths, and materiality
2. Overview
GGE functions as the systematic brain of the governance ecosystem:
  Treats SOPs as derived artifacts, not primary sources
  Stores and tracks atomic components (e.g., thresholds, authority rules, risk parameters)
  Maintains a dependency graph of SOPs, ensuring correct update order
  Provides a prompt-driven decision layer for determining impact, strategy, and versioning
  Automatically emits updated, versioned SOP documents in an auditable manner
Key Features:
  Component registry and version control
  SOP dependency mapping
  Automated impact analysis and update planning
  Version bump logic and semantic versioning
  Integration-ready outputs for internal systems
3. Scope
Entities Covered:
  Parent / HoldCo
  All operating subsidiaries
  Future domestic or international entities
Areas Covered:
  Financial operations (Capital, Cash, Intercompany)
  Operational SOPs (Revenue, Fulfillment, Brand & Store)
  Intellectual property and licensing
  Risk, contingency, and compliance
  Tax positioning and transfer pricing
Exclusions:
  SOP content creation (human expertise is required for legal and strategic input)
  Third-party operational execution (GGE supports orchestration, not execution)
4. Value Added
 Consistency: Eliminates drift between SOPs and actual governance practice
 Scalability: Automatically manages multiple subsidiaries and future entities
 Auditability: Maintains clear trails of changes, approvals, and version history
 Efficiency: Reduces manual review and cross-referencing work
 Decision Support: Embedded logic considers dependencies, materiality, and authority
 Risk Reduction: Ensures updates do not inadvertently violate compliance, risk, or legal boundaries
5. Components of GGE
 Component Registry: Atomic governance elements (e.g., authority matrix, materiality thresholds, risk scenarios)
 SOP Dependency Graph: Maps which SOPs depend on which components
 Update Decision Prompt: Determines update strategy, order, and versioning type
 Versioning Engine: Applies semantic versioning based on type and scope of changes
 SOP Generator: Produces updated SOPs in defined formats, ready for approval and deployment
 Audit Log: Tracks all component changes, update decisions, and SOP emissions
6. GGE Operational Workflow (High-Level)
 Component Update: New data, thresholds, or authority rules are added to the registry
 Impact Analysis: Dependency graph identifies affected SOPs
 Decision Prompt: GGE evaluates order, priority, and version bump strategy
 SOP Regeneration: SOPs are updated automatically with new references, cross-links, and versioning
 Review & Approval: Designated approvers validate the updates
 Release & Logging: Updated SOPs are published and changes are logged for auditability
7. Governance Principles Embedded in GGE
  SOPs are derived artifacts: Components drive updates, not manual edits
  Arm’s-length authority: Updates reflect defined authority levels
  Materiality-sensitive updates: Changes are prioritized and escalated based on thresholds
  Auditability: All actions are recorded
  Scalable orchestration: Supports multiple subsidiaries and entities
8. Expected Outcomes
  Living SOPs with consistent, current references across the organization
  Reduced human error in updates and alignment
  Clearly defined escalation and update logic
  Ready-to-integrate governance outputs for internal and external audit
  Foundation for future system automation and operational analytics
9. Next Development Steps
 Define Component Taxonomy
 Build Update Decision Prompt logic
 Formalize Versioning Rules Engine
 Sketch System Architecture & Workflows
 Begin Pilot SOP Update Cycle

GGE Update Decision Prompt Specification v0.1
Overview
Document Title: Governance Graph Engine – Update Decision Prompt Specification 
Document ID: NS-GGP-005-DECISION
Version: 0.1 
Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: As Needed / Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
This document defines the Update Decision Prompt (UDP) used by the Governance Graph Engine (GGE) to reason about governance changes.
The UDP is the strategic reasoning layer that:
  Interprets component deltas
  Evaluates dependency impact
  Recommends SOP update scope and order
  Proposes version increments
  Flags risk, compliance, or authority concerns
The UDP is advisory only. All decisions remain subject to deterministic rules and human approval.
2. Design Principles
The Update Decision Prompt must:
  Be deterministic-first
  Be explainable and auditable
  Never auto-approve changes
  Produce structured, machine-readable output
  Operate idempotently given identical inputs
3. Inputs to the Update Decision Prompt
Each UDP invocation receives a structured input package.
3.1 Execution Context
  GGE Execution ID
  Trigger Type (Component Change, Scheduled Review, Risk Event, Manual)
  Executor Role
  Timestamp
3.2 Component Delta Set
For each changed component:
  Component ID
  Component Type
  Previous Version
  Proposed Version
  Nature of Change (Add / Modify / Deprecate)
  Materiality Classification
3.3 Dependency Impact Map
  Directly impacted components
  Indirectly impacted components
  Affected SOPs
  Dependency depth
3.4 Governance Constraints
  Authority Matrix snapshot
  Materiality thresholds
  Compliance rules
  Risk tolerance levels
4. Reasoning Tasks
The UDP must perform the following reasoning tasks:
 Impact Classification
  Substantive vs non-substantive change
  Governance-critical vs informational
 Version Recommendation
  Major / Minor / Patch per SOP
  Justification for each recommendation
 Update Sequencing
  Determine correct SOP update order
  Identify prerequisite updates
 Risk & Compliance Flagging
  Identify elevated risk areas
  Flag compliance or tax implications
 Approval Routing Suggestions
  Recommend approval roles
  Identify escalation triggers
5. Output Schema
The UDP must return a structured output object.
5.1 Summary
  Execution ID
  High-level change narrative
  Overall risk level
5.2 SOP Update Recommendations
For each SOP:
  SOP ID
  Current Version
  Recommended New Version
  Change Type (Major / Minor / Patch)
  Rationale
5.3 Update Order
  Ordered list of SOP IDs
  Dependency justification
5.4 Risk & Compliance Flags
  Flag Type
  Severity
  Affected Components/SOPs
  Recommended Mitigation
5.5 Approval Suggestions
  Required approver roles
  Optional reviewers
  Escalation notes
5.6 Confidence & Limitations
  Areas of uncertainty
  Assumptions made
6. Prompt Structure (Logical)
The Update Decision Prompt is structured logically as:
 System Context
 Governance Principles
 Component Delta Description
 Dependency Impact Map
 Explicit Reasoning Tasks
 Output Schema Enforcement
7. Example Prompt Skeleton (Abstracted)
SYSTEM:
You are an advisory governance reasoning engine for GGE.

INPUT:
[Execution Context]
[Component Delta Set]
[Dependency Map]
[Governance Constraints]

TASKS:
1. Classify impact
2. Recommend SOP version changes
3. Determine update order
4. Flag risks and compliance issues
5. Suggest approval routing

OUTPUT:
Return JSON matching the defined output schema.
8. Determinism & Audit Controls
  UDP outputs are stored with execution records
  Prompt version is recorded
  Model version is recorded
  No free-text-only outputs permitted
9. Non-Goals
  Final decision authority
  Automatic SOP modification
  Regulatory interpretation
10. Version Control

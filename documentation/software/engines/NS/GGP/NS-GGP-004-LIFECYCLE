Overview
Document Title: Governance Graph Engine – Execution Lifecycle Specification 
Document ID: NS-GGP-004-LIFECYCLE
Version: 0.1 
Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: As Needed / Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
This document defines the end-to-end execution lifecycle of the Governance Graph Engine (GGE). It specifies how governance changes are ingested, evaluated, propagated, approved, compiled into SOPs, and recorded for audit.
The lifecycle ensures:
  Deterministic governance updates
  Controlled version propagation
  Full auditability
  Clear human-in-the-loop checkpoints
2. Scope
This specification applies to:
  All GGE executions (manual or scheduled)
  All component changes (authority, materiality, risk, SOP, etc.)
  All SOP compilation events
  All audit and approval flows
Excluded:
  External regulatory filing execution
  Non-governance operational workflows
3. Execution Triggers
GGE execution may be triggered by:
 Component Change Event
  New component created
  Existing component updated
  Component deprecated
 Scheduled Review Event
  Periodic governance review
  SOP review cycle reached
 Risk or Compliance Event
  Risk threshold breach
  Regulatory change flag
 Manual Invocation
  Explicit execution by authorized role
Each trigger produces a GGE Execution ID.
4. Lifecycle Phases
Phase 1: Ingestion & Validation
Objective: Validate inputs before governance impact analysis.
Steps:
  Authenticate executor
  Validate component schema
  Verify permissions
  Lock affected components
Outputs:
  Validated component delta set
  Execution context snapshot
Phase 2: Dependency Graph Resolution
Objective: Identify downstream impacts.
Steps:
  Traverse dependency graph
  Identify impacted components
  Identify affected SOPs
  Classify impact severity
Outputs:
  Impact map
  Affected SOP list
Phase 3: Version Impact Assessment
Objective: Determine version increments.
Steps:
  Apply versioning rules
  Classify changes (major/minor/patch)
  Generate proposed new versions
Outputs:
  Version bump plan
  Change classification report
Phase 4: Advisory Analysis (Optional)
Objective: Provide non-binding recommendations.
Steps:
  Generate change summaries
  Suggest update sequencing
  Flag risk or compliance concerns
Outputs:
  Advisory report
Advisory outputs never auto-apply changes.
Phase 5: Approval Workflow
Objective: Obtain required human approvals.
Steps:
  Route approvals per Authority Matrix
  Collect approvals, rejections, or comments
  Handle escalations if required
Outputs:
  Approval decision set
Phase 6: SOP Compilation
Objective: Produce updated SOP artifacts.
Steps:
  Apply approved changes
  Regenerate SOP sections
  Update metadata and references
Outputs:
  New SOP versions
  Compilation logs
Phase 7: Audit Recording & Publication
Objective: Record immutable execution history.
Steps:
  Write execution audit record
  Persist version lineage
  Publish SOPs to repository
Outputs:
  Immutable audit trail
  Published SOP artifacts
5. Execution States
Each execution progresses through states:
 Initialized
 Validated
 Analyzed
 Pending Approval
 Approved / Rejected
 Compiled
 Published
 Closed
State transitions are recorded immutably.
6. Failure & Rollback Handling
  Validation failures halt execution
  Approval rejection closes execution without publication
  Partial compilation failures trigger rollback
  All failures are audit logged
No destructive changes occur without approval.
7. Audit Trail Requirements
Each execution must record:
  Execution ID
  Trigger type
  Executor
  Timestamp
  Input components
  Impacted SOPs
  Version changes
  Approval decisions
  Final outcome
8. Security & Access Control
  Execution initiation restricted by role
  Approval enforced via Authority Matrix
  Read-only audit access for observers
  No direct SOP editing outside GGE
9. Non-Goals
  Autonomous governance changes
  Auto-approval of material changes
  Real-time operational enforcement
10. Version Control

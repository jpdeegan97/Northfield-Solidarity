GGE Component Taxonomy
Overview
System Name: Governance Graph Engine (GGE) 
Document Title: Governance Graph Engine Component Taxonomy 
Document Id: NS-GGP-002-TAXONOMY
Version: 0.1 
Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office 
Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager 
Effective Date: TBD 
Review Cycle: Annual or Upon Material Change
1. Purpose
The Component Taxonomy defines all atomic governance elements that form the source-of-truth for the Governance Graph Engine (GGE). These components drive SOP generation, versioning, and dependency management.
Objectives:
  Ensure consistent, modular representation of governance elements
  Support automated SOP updates through structured data
  Define interdependencies between components, SOPs, and decision logic
2. Component Categories
 Authority Components
  Authority Matrix
  Approval levels (Execute, Approve, Review, Recommend, Override)
  Role definitions (Parent, Subsidiary, Finance, Compliance, Legal, Tax)
 Materiality Components
  Thresholds for financial transactions
  Risk sensitivity levels (Low, Medium, High, Emergency)
  Operational limits and tolerances
 SOP Components
  SOP metadata (Title, ID, Version, Effective Date, Review Cycle)
  SOP sections (Purpose, Scope, Procedures, Controls, KPIs, etc.)
  SOP dependency references (cross-SOP citations)
 Process / Workflow Components
  Inputs and outputs of each SOP
  Step-by-step process definitions
  Escalation paths
  Exception handling rules
 Risk & Contingency Components
  Risk events and scenarios
  Trigger thresholds
  Escalation and mitigation procedures
 IP & Licensing Components
  IP assets
  Licensing terms
  Approval and oversight requirements
 Financial Components
  Capital flows
  Intercompany transactions
  Revenue and cash flow rules
  Accounting treatment rules
 Compliance & Tax Components
  Regulatory rules
  Filing requirements
  Transfer pricing policies
  Tax elections
 System & Metadata Components
  Versioning schema
  Component creation and update history
  Dependency graph references
  Audit logs and records
3. Component Attributes
Each component should include the following attributes:
Attribute
Description
Component ID
Unique identifier
Name
Clear descriptive name
Type
Category (Authority, Materiality, Risk, etc.)
Version
Current version number
Dependencies
Other components/SOPs it affects
Status
Active, Deprecated, Pending
Owner
Responsible role/entity
Effective Date
Date of current version
Review Cycle
Frequency of review
Notes
Additional context or rules
4. Component Relationships
  Hierarchical dependencies: Authority components may govern multiple SOPs.
  Cross-SOP references: Materiality changes impact Financial SOPs, Capital Flow, and Intercompany SOPs.
  Event-driven updates: Risk or compliance events trigger automatic reassessment of related components.
  Version propagation: Changes to a component trigger version bumps in dependent SOPs according to GGE rules.
5. Next Steps
 Assign initial Component IDs and ownership.
 Map dependencies for all current SOPs.
 Configure GGE to recognize each component and track versioning.
 Build automated impact analysis rules based on taxonomy.

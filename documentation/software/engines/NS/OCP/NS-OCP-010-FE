NS-OCP-010 — FE (Front-End / Operator Experience)

0. Document Control

Program: Northfield Solidarity (NS)

Engine: OCP — Onchain Compute Plane

Document ID: NS-OCP-010-FE

Status: Draft v1

Depends On: NS-OCP-003-ARCHITECTURE, NS-OCP-007-DATAMODEL, NS-OCP-009-IMPL

Owner: OCP Lead (TBD)

1. Purpose

OCP’s FE is the human-facing layer that makes OCP usable and safe day-to-day.

It provides:

an Operator Console for deployments, monitoring, and incident response

a Product Team Console for discovering contracts, networks, SDKs, and integrations

a Governance View for approvals, waivers, and change provenance

OCP FE does not replace existing NS UIs; it provides a focused interface aligned to OCP controls and artifacts.

2. Personas

2.1 OCP Operator (ChainOps)

deploys releases

validates monitoring

responds to incidents

2.2 Smart Contract Engineer

registers packages

manages versions and artifacts

reviews gate outcomes

2.3 Security & Assurance

reviews threat models

tracks audit findings and remediation

approves gates (where policy requires)

2.4 Product Team (dApp)

looks up addresses/ABIs

checks compatibility notes

monitors runtime behavior for their product

2.5 Governance (GGP/GGE)

approves production releases and upgrades

reviews waivers

audits decision history

3. FE Surfaces (Apps)

3.1 Operator Console (OCP Ops)

Primary purpose: keep production safe.

Core pages:

Overview Dashboard

systems by environment

release status and recent changes

active alerts and incidents

Release Center

create/view release manifests

gate results (pass/fail/waive)

approval status (GGP/GGE)

execute deployment (if interactive) or view pipeline execution logs

Deployments & Registry

deployments by network and system

addresses, versions, provenance, authority set

quick links to runbooks and dashboards

Incidents

active incidents

containment actions checklist

postmortem creation workflow

3.2 Product Console (OCP Hub)

Primary purpose: help teams consume OCP safely.

Core pages:

System Catalog

searchable list of OCP systems

risk class and upgrade stance

supported networks

Contract Explorer

ABI download / SDK references

addresses per network

version timeline

Integration Kit

code snippets (read-only)

event schemas and signal definitions

indexer endpoints and query examples

Compatibility Matrix

which dApp versions support which contract deployments

3.3 Governance View (OCP + GGP/GGE)

Primary purpose: make approvals auditable.

Core pages:

Approvals Ledger

releases awaiting approval

approvals history

linked artifacts and risk class

Waivers

waiver requests

rationale + expiration

enforcement (auto-expire / re-approval)

Decision Records (OCP-ADR)

chain selection decisions

upgrade stance decisions

custody/vendor decisions

4. Information Architecture (Navigation)

Recommended top-level nav:

Systems

Deployments

Releases

Security

Signals

Incidents

Governance

Providers

Settings

5. Core UI Components

5.1 System Card

system name + ID

risk class badge

environment status (DEV/TEST/PROD)

upgrade stance

last release timestamp

5.2 Release Gate Panel

gate checklist with PASS/FAIL/WAIVE

links to evidence (threat model, analysis, audit)

approval status (who/when)

5.3 Deployment Detail Panel

network + address

version lineage (package + artifact set)

authority set (admin/guardian/timelock)

runbook + dashboards

5.4 Signal Stream

recent privileged actions

revert spikes

pause state changes

indexer lag warnings

5.5 Incident Workbench

incident timeline

containment checklist

comms templates

postmortem scaffold

6. FE Data Contracts (API Needs)

FE reads from the Contract Registry and supporting services.

Minimum queries:

list systems with filters: risk_class, status, environment

list deployments by system/network/environment

release details including gate results and approvals

authority set and role bindings for a system

security artifacts and audit findings for a system

signal events and alert status

incident list and incident detail

Write actions (restricted):

create release manifest (or attach manifest)

request approvals / create waiver request

create incident record and attach postmortem

All write actions should be gated by role-based access and (for sensitive actions) governance approvals.

7. FE Permissions (RBAC)

OCP FE permissions map to OCP roles.

7.1 Roles

OCP_VIEWER: read-only access to systems, deployments, releases

OCP_ENGINEER: register packages/artifacts; view gates

OCP_OPERATOR: execute releases (where interactive) and manage incidents

OCP_SECURITY: approve artifacts, review findings, request gate waivers

OCP_GOVERNANCE: approve releases/upgrades; approve/deny waivers

7.2 Access Principles

least privilege

separation of duties

PROD actions require elevated role + approvals

8. UX Safety Features (Blockchain-Specific)

OCP FE must reduce operator and user risk:

Explicit network context (always show network + environment; no hidden mainnet)

Transaction preview

decoded call data

estimated impact summary (where possible)

Address hygiene

ENS/name resolution where available

warnings for unknown addresses

High-risk action friction

confirm step + reason capture

“two-person rule” workflow for critical actions

Immutable provenance links

click-through to receipts and registry records

9. Front-End Technical Direction (v1)

OCP FE should be light-weight and consistent with NS front-end patterns.

Recommended v1:

React + TypeScript

shared component library consistent with NS

authentication via NS identity layer (IDN)

Deployment:

internal-only initially

audit logs for all write actions

10. MVP vs Later

10.1 MVP (Must Have)

Systems catalog

Deployment explorer (addresses, versions, authority)

Release view with gates + approvals status

Security artifacts list (threat model, audit report links)

Signal/alert basic dashboard

10.2 Later (Nice to Have)

interactive release execution (if not purely pipeline driven)

richer decoded tx impact analysis

incident workbench with automation

vendor/provider health dashboards

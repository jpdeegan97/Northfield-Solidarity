Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Financial Ledger Orchestrator (FLO).
The taxonomy establishes the atomic financial primitives used to:
Represent financial truth consistently across engines
Enforce budgets, allocations, and constraints
Enable reconciliation, audit, and downstream performance attribution
This taxonomy is the shared financial language for FLO, DAT, MUX, GGP, PTE, and human operators.
2. Taxonomy Design Principles
Ledger-First Truth — all financial facts resolve to ledger entries
Append-Only Semantics — financial history is never overwritten
Event-Derived Accounting — ledger entries are derived from source events
Version & Source Attribution — every amount ties to a cause and authority
Entity-Centric Accounting — money always belongs to an entity and account
3. Core Financial Primitives
3.1 Financial Event
Definition:
A raw or normalized event that indicates a potential financial impact.
Examples:
spend.incurred
refund.received
fee.charged
payout.received
Financial events are inputs, not authoritative truth.
3.2 Ledger Entry
Definition:
The canonical, authoritative record of a financial fact.
Characteristics:
Append-only
Immutable
Derived from one or more financial events
Examples:
debit: advertising expense
credit: marketplace payout
3.3 Transaction
Definition:
A logical grouping of ledger entries that represent a single financial action.
Examples:
Marketplace sale
Supplier purchase
Refund issuance
Transactions ensure ledger balance and explainability.
3.4 Account
Definition:
A logical container representing where money is held or tracked.
Examples:
Bank account
Payment processor balance
Accrued fees
Accounts belong to entities and are typed.
3.5 Entity
Definition:
A legal or logical owner of financial activity.
Examples:
Holding company
Subsidiary
Vendor
Customer
Entity identity is sourced from IDN / PECA.
3.6 Budget
Definition:
A governed financial limit applied to activities, plans, or time windows.
Characteristics:
Approved by GGP
Enforced continuously
Referenced by DAT execution plans
3.7 Allocation
Definition:
A subdivision of a budget or pool of funds.
Examples:
Campaign allocation
Product-line allocation
Allocations allow granular spend tracking.
3.8 Balance
Definition:
A derived value representing the net sum of ledger entries for an account.
Balances are never authoritative; they are computed from ledger entries.
4. Evidence & Traceability Primitives
4.1 Evidence Artifact
Definition:
A reference to external proof supporting a ledger entry.
Examples:
Receipt ID
Invoice PDF
Processor transaction ID
Evidence is linked, not embedded.
4.2 Source Attribution
Definition:
Metadata identifying why a ledger entry exists.
Examples:
DAT execution_plan_id + plan_version
MUX processor event ID
Manual adjustment reference
5. Reconciliation Primitives
5.1 External Statement
Definition:
A record from an external system (bank, processor, marketplace).
Used to reconcile against internal ledger.
5.2 Reconciliation Record
Definition:
A record describing the comparison between ledger and external statement.
Outcomes:
matched
missing
excess
disputed
6. Financial State Concepts
Although FLO is append-only, it exposes financial state concepts:
Budget state (available / near_limit / exhausted)
Allocation state
Reconciliation state
These states are derived, not stored as truth.
7. Relationships Between Primitives
Financial Event → Ledger Entry
Ledger Entry → Transaction
Transaction → Account
Account → Entity
Ledger Entry → Budget / Allocation (optional)
Ledger Entry → Evidence Artifact (optional)
8. Cross-Engine Alignment



Engine

Interaction with FLO


DAT

Emits financial-impacting events


MUX

Supplies external payment/payout events


GGP

Governs budgets and approvals


PTE

Consumes ledger-derived performance metrics


IDN / PECA

Supplies entity/account identity
FLO primitives must be referenced—not reimplemented—by other engines.
9. Invariants & Safety Rules
Ledger entries are immutable
Every ledger entry has a source
Budgets are enforced against ledger truth
Balances are derived, never authoritative
Reconciliation never mutates ledger history
10. Document Position in FLO Corpus
This taxonomy document builds upon:
NS-FLO-001 — OVERVIEW
It informs:
NS-FLO-003 — ARCHITECTURE
NS-FLO-004 — LIFECYCLE
NS-FLO-007 — DATAMODEL

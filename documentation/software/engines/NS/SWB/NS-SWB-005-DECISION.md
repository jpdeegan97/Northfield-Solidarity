# NS-SWB-005-DECISION — Decisions & Defaults

Defaults: all model calls go through SWB; policy gate before external calls; progressive enhancement; return/store route metadata; deterministic mode for compliance-critical workflows.

Configurable: caching by classification; ensemble plans for Premium/Verified; provider redundancy; web/tool usage opt-in per request.

Anti-patterns: one universal model; no audit; silent fallbacks; mixing sensitive payloads without redaction boundaries.

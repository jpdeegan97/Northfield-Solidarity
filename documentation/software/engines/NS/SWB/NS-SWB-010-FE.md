# NS-SWB-010-FE — Frontend / UX

Operator Console:
- Requests dashboard
- Route inspector (classification, gate, plan, fallbacks)
- Model registry and policy viewer
- Metrics (cost/latency/success/fallback/error rate)
- Replay with pinned versions (if permitted)
- Redaction preview (what transforms were applied)

UX: “Why this model?” must be obvious; governance status prominent; operator-only details separated from caller view.

NS-CWP-001 — OVERVIEW
Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides the authoritative overview of the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP).
CWP is the agentic HR, operations, and management plane for Northfield Solidarity. It is responsible for structuring, assigning, supervising, and auditing work performed by human agents, AI agents, and hybrid teams across the entire engine ecosystem.
CWP exists to answer one core question:
Who (or what) is doing what work, why, under which constraints, and with what accountability?
2. What CWP Is
CWP is the operational cognition layer of the system.
It:
  defines work as explicit, versioned artifacts
  assigns work to agents (human, AI, or hybrid)
  enforces cadence, SLAs, and review loops
  tracks execution, outcomes, and escalation
  provides auditable visibility into how decisions and knowledge are produced
CWP translates intent into coordinated action.
3. What CWP Is Not
To preserve architectural clarity, CWP is explicitly not:
  a governance authority (that is GGP)
  a financial execution or ledger system (FLO)
  a signal ingestion or intelligence engine (SIG, PIE, DRE)
  a direct execution engine (DAT, CDE)
CWP orchestrates work; it does not decide policy, move money, or execute actions.
4. Role Within the Northfield Solidarity Ecosystem
CWP sits horizontally across the system, interfacing with nearly every engine.
It acts as the coordination and supervision plane for:
  research (DRE)
  insight synthesis (PIE)
  simulation work (SIM)
  execution preparation (DAT)
  content distribution (CDE)
  portfolio tracking and observability (PTE)
CWP never bypasses governance; it works within GGP constraints.
5. Core Responsibilities
At a high level, CWP is responsible for:
 Agent Management
  define agent types, capabilities, and roles
  manage human, AI, and hybrid workers
 Work Definition
  formalize tasks, missions, and programs
  define success criteria and constraints
 Assignment & Scheduling
  assign work to appropriate agents
  enforce cadence and prioritization
 Supervision & Review
  require checkpoints and reviews
  route outputs for validation
 Escalation & Exception Handling
  detect stalled or failing work
  escalate to humans or governance when needed
 Audit & Traceability
  maintain a full trail of who did what, when, and why
6. CWP and Agentic Systems
CWP provides the safety rails for agentic operation.
Rather than allowing free-running agents, CWP:
  constrains agent behavior via explicit tasks
  binds work to versioned inputs and outputs
  enforces review gates
  records all actions as auditable events
This allows Northfield Solidarity to leverage agentic systems without sacrificing control or accountability.
7. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
CWP Interaction
DRE
Assigns and supervises research missions
PIE
Coordinates insight generation tasks
SIM
Schedules scenario exploration work
DAT
Manages execution planning workflows
CDE
Oversees content distribution plans
PTE
Feeds execution outcomes for performance tracking
GGP
Receives constraints and escalation pathways
IDN
Resolves agent identities and roles
8. Operational Posture
CWP is:
  write-heavy for task and state changes
  event-driven for supervision and escalation
  replayable for audit and forensic analysis
  human-visible by design
CWP prioritizes clarity of work over speed of execution.
9. Expected Outcomes
When CWP is functioning correctly:
  agentic work is bounded and explainable
  humans know where attention is required
  research and execution pipelines stay healthy
  failures escalate early, not silently
  audit and compliance are natural byproducts
CWP makes complex systems operable.

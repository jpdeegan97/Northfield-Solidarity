Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy of the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP).
The taxonomy establishes the atomic, composable building blocks of work used to coordinate, supervise, and audit human and agentic activity across Northfield Solidarity.
This taxonomy ensures:
  consistent definition of work across engines
  safe agentic execution
  explicit accountability and escalation
  replayable operational history
2. Taxonomy Design Principles
 Work Is Explicit — no implicit or background activity
 Agents Are Bounded — agents act only within assigned work
 Hierarchy Without Ambiguity — tasks compose into missions and programs
 Human Authority Is Preserved — acceptance and escalation require humans
 Everything Is Auditable — all work emits events
3. Core Identity Primitives
3.1 Agent
Represents an actor capable of performing work.
Types:
  human_agent
  ai_agent
  hybrid_agent
Attributes:
  agent_id (IDN canonical)
  agent_type
  capabilities
  trust_level
  availability_state
Agents never act outside assigned work.
3.2 Role
Defines a responsibility profile.
Attributes:
  role_id
  name
  permitted_actions
  review_authority
Roles are assigned to agents dynamically.
4. Work Primitives
4.1 Task
The smallest unit of work.
Attributes:
  task_id
  description
  input_refs
  expected_output
  constraints
  assigned_agent_id
  status
  created_at
States:
  pending
  in_progress
  blocked
  completed
  failed
4.2 Mission
A coordinated set of tasks with a shared objective.
Attributes:
  mission_id
  objective
  task_ids
  success_criteria
  sla
  priority
  owner_agent_id
4.3 Program
A long-running collection of missions.
Attributes:
  program_id
  strategic_goal
  mission_ids
  cadence
  governance_constraints
Programs align work to strategy.
5. Control & Supervision Primitives
5.1 Checkpoint
A required review point.
Attributes:
  checkpoint_id
  work_ref
  reviewer_role
  acceptance_criteria
  due_at
5.2 Review
A formal evaluation of work output.
Attributes:
  review_id
  checkpoint_id
  outcome
  notes
  reviewed_by
  reviewed_at
5.3 Escalation
Represents failure or risk requiring intervention.
Attributes:
  escalation_id
  trigger_condition
  severity
  routed_to
  resolution_status
6. Scheduling & Cadence Primitives
6.1 SLA
Defines time and quality expectations.
Attributes:
  sla_id
  response_time
  completion_time
  quality_threshold
6.2 Schedule
Defines when work runs.
Attributes:
  schedule_id
  trigger_type (time, event, manual)
  recurrence
7. State & Event Primitives
7.1 Work State
All work artifacts maintain explicit state.
Common states:
  created
  assigned
  active
  waiting_review
  completed
  escalated
  closed
7.2 Work Event
Append-only record of activity.
Attributes:
  event_id
  event_type
  work_ref
  actor_id
  payload
  occurred_at
8. Cross-Engine Work Bindings
CWP work artifacts may reference:
  DRE artifacts (themes, hypotheses)
  PIE insights
  SIM scenarios
  DAT execution plans
  CDE content plans
CWP never mutates domain artifacts; it supervises work around them.
9. Invariants
  no agent performs unassigned work
  no work completes without meeting acceptance criteria
  escalations are explicit and logged
  governance constraints are always respected
10. Document Position in CWP Corpus
This taxonomy underpins:
  NS-CWP-003 — ARCHITECTURE
  NS-CWP-004 — LIFECYCLE
  NS-CWP-005 — DECISION

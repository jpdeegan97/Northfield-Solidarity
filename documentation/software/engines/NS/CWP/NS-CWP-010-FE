NS-CWP-010 — FE (Operator UI)

0. Overview

This document defines the optional Front-End (FE) Operator UI for CWP (Cognitive Work Plane).

CWP’s UI is the operational cockpit for:

task intake and triage

queues, assignments, and SLAs

playbook execution (SOP runner)

approvals and human-in-the-loop steps

evidence capture and completion verification

performance signals (cycle time, throughput, rework)

CWP FE must remain governed by GGP and identity-scoped via IDN.

1. User Roles & Access

1.1 Roles (conceptual)

Operator: triage tasks, manage queues, reassign work

Worker (Human): execute assigned tasks and steps

Approver: respond to approvals (approve/deny/request changes)

Supervisor/Manager: monitor SLAs and performance; handle escalations

Admin: manage playbooks, queue routing rules, templates

1.2 Access model

Identity: via IDN

Authorization:

task visibility scoped by role/queue/tenant

approval eligibility resolved via IDN + GGP decisions

sensitive actions gated by GGP

All meaningful UI actions emit events to LUM.

2. Core UI Areas

2.1 Home Dashboard

Purpose: one-glance operational health.

Widgets

open tasks by priority

SLA risk count (due soon / breached)

blocked tasks count

approvals pending

exception inbox count

throughput (today/7d)

Primary interactions

jump to queue view

jump to approvals

jump to exceptions

2.2 Task Inbox (My Work)

Purpose: worker-centric execution.

Table columns

priority

task title

queue

state

due/SLA

created_at

correlation chips (workflow_id, decision_id, integration_id)

Actions

start task

mark step complete

request help/escalate

attach evidence

comment

2.3 Queue Board (Operations)

Purpose: triage and routing.

Views

kanban (queued/assigned/in_progress/blocked)

table (filter/sort)

Filters

queue

priority

SLA status

task type

integration_id

owner

Actions

assign/unassign

requeue

set priority

set due date

bulk triage

2.4 Task Detail Page

Purpose: execute and verify completion.

Sections

header: title, state, priority, due, owner

description + context

correlation panel (workflow_id, decision_id, entity_id, integration_id)

playbook runner (steps list)

evidence panel (required vs attached)

approvals panel (pending/granted/denied)

activity feed (events + comments)

Actions

transition state (guarded)

complete step

attach evidence

create subtask

link related task

2.5 Playbook Runner (SOP Execution)

Purpose: make SOP steps executable.

Features

step list with status (pending/running/blocked/completed/failed)

step type badges (human/agent/integration/approval/evidence)

required artifacts per step

timers and retries (where allowed)

Step actions

start/complete

mark blocked + reason

request approval (if gate)

execute integration call (via MUX)

2.6 Approvals Center

Purpose: concentrated approval UX.

Views

approvals assigned to me

approvals awaiting someone else (supervisor visibility)

Approval card

request summary

spend/risk summary (if applicable)

evidence preview

decision rationale (from GGP)

buttons: approve / deny / request changes

Constraints

approval actions must produce a decision_id (or reference an existing one)

approvals must be time-boxed with SLA

2.7 Exceptions / Blockers Inbox

Purpose: manage stuck work.

Features

list blocked tasks with blocker reasons

SLA breach indicators

suggested next actions

Actions

escalate to supervisor

spawn subtask

notify external party (via MUX)

request policy clarification (GGP)

2.8 Worker Registry (Agents & Humans)

Purpose: manage worker profiles.

Features

worker list (humans/agents)

capabilities/skills tags

availability/load indicators

eligibility constraints (from IDN)

Actions

enable/disable agent

adjust capability tags

set assignment limits

2.9 Templates & Playbooks Library

Purpose: manage SOPs.

Features

list playbooks by domain (AP, ops, marketing, etc.)

version history

required evidence definitions

governance gate references

Actions

create new playbook version

deprecate playbook

run playbook on a task

2.10 Reporting & Performance

Purpose: measure operational performance.

Core metrics

cycle time (p50/p95)

throughput by queue

SLA breach rate

rework rate (tasks reopened)

approval latency

Filters

time window

queue

owner/worker

task type

3. Global UI Conventions

3.1 Priority & SLA

priorities (starter): P0/P1/P2/P3

SLA status chips:

on track

due soon

breached

3.2 State enforcement

state transitions only allowed if valid by state machine

show “why blocked” with required next step

3.3 Evidence UX

required evidence checklist

attach link/file/hash

completion blocked until required evidence attached

3.4 Correlation chips

Every page should support quick navigation by:

workflow_id

task_id

decision_id

integration_id

4. Navigation (Suggested)

Home

My Work

Queues

Approvals

Exceptions

Playbooks

Workers

Reports

Admin

5. MVP UI Scope

MVP should ship:

Home Dashboard

My Work inbox

Queue Board

Task Detail (with evidence panel)

Approvals Center

Defer to v1:

Worker registry UI

Playbook version management UI

Advanced reporting dashboards

6. Security & Audit Requirements

all task changes emit events to LUM

approval actions must be recorded with decision_id

evidence attachments must be access-controlled

role-based visibility enforced via IDN

7. UX Notes (Operator Ergonomics)

one-click “claim task”

keyboard-first triage shortcuts

quick filters for SLA breaches and approvals

deep links to LUM correlation view for workflow_id

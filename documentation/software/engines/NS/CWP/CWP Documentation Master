Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
Documentation Master Plan (Aligned to NS-GGP Canonical Template)
PurposeThis document defines the authoritative documentation master plan for the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP), strictly aligned to the existing NS-GGP document structure (000–014).
CWP is the agentic HR, operations, and management plane for Northfield Solidarity. It is responsible for representing, coordinating, and supervising agentic workers (human, AI, and hybrid), operational tasks, roles, responsibilities, and performance — while remaining fully governed by GGP.
CWP is not:
A governance authority (GGP)
A financial system (FLO)
A pure execution engine (DAT)
CWP is the operational cognition layer that translates intent into coordinated work.

CWP Documentation Index (Canonical)

NS-CWP-000 — CHARTER
Purpose: Define why CWP exists
Scope:
Mission of CWP
Why agentic work coordination must be centralized
CWP’s role as the operational nervous system
Explicit non-goals (policy governance, accounting, market execution)
Mirrors: NS-GGP-000

NS-CWP-001 — OVERVIEW
Purpose: High-level conceptual framing
Scope:
What CWP manages (agents, roles, tasks, workflows)
Relationship to human operators and AI agents
Interaction with core engines (GGP, DAT, PTE)
Mirrors: NS-GGP-001

NS-CWP-002 — TAXONOMY
Purpose: Define CWP’s atomic work concepts
Scope:
Agent (human / AI / hybrid)
Role
Capability
Task
Workflow
Performance Signal
Mirrors: NS-GGP-002

NS-CWP-003 — ARCHITECTURE
Purpose: Logical work orchestration architecture
Scope:
Agent registry
Task routing

Logical design only (not infra).
Mirrors: NS-GGP-003

NS-CWP-004 — LIFECYCLE
Purpose: End-to-end work lifecycle
Scope:
Task creation
Assignment
Execution
Review
Completion or escalation
Mirrors: NS-GGP-004

NS-CWP-005 — DECISION
Purpose: Work assignment and escalation semantics
Scope:
Automated vs manual task assignment
Performance-based reassignment
Escalation to humans or governance
CWP decides how work flows; GGP decides what is allowed.

Purpose: Work persistence and contracts
Scope:
Agent records
Task state
Performance metrics
Replay assumptions
Mirrors: NS-GGP-007

NS-CWP-008 — EEE (End-to-End Example)
Purpose: Validate agentic work flow
Scope:

NS-CWP-009 — IMPL
Purpose: Implementation blueprint
Scope:
MVP agent coordinator
Task queueing
Feedback capture
Mirrors: NS-GGP-009

NS-CWP-010 — FE / VISUALIZATION
Purpose: Work and agent observability UX
Scope:
Agent dashboards
Task queues
Performance views
Mirrors: NS-GGP-010

NS-CWP-011 — APIMAP
Purpose: API → work surface mapping
Scope:
Task submission APIs
Agent management APIs
Status and telemetry endpoints
Mirrors: NS-GGP-011

NS-CWP-012 — STATE
Purpose: Work state semantics
Scope:
In-flight tasks
Retry and failure states
Consistency guarantees
Mirrors: NS-GGP-012

NS-CWP-013 — RUNBOOK
Purpose: Operational work controls
Scope:
Agent onboarding/offboarding
Emergency stop
Load shedding
Mirrors: NS-GGP-013

NS-CWP-014 — DATADEF
Purpose: Canonical work data definitions
Scope:
Agent schema
Task schema
Performance schema
Mirrors: NS-GGP-014

Cross-Engine Dependencies
CWP integrates with but does not own:
GGP — governance and authorization
IDN — identity and trust
DAT — execution tasks
PTE — performance and portfolio visibility
SIG — operational signals

Completion Criteria
CWP documentation is complete when:
NS-CWP-000 → NS-CWP-014 exist
Agentic work is observable, auditable, and governable
Humans remain in control of escalation and override

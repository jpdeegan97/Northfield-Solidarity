NS-CWP-000 — CHARTER

0. Overview

System Name: Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)

Document Title: NSDC Engine Charter — CWP (Cognitive Work Plane)

Document ID: NS-CWP-000-CHARTER

Version: 0.1

Prepared By: Strategy & Governance Office

Approved By: Parent / HoldCo Manager

Effective Date: TBD

Review Cycle: Annual or upon material change

1. Engine Identity

Engine Name: Cognitive Work Plane

Acronym: CWP

Engine Type: Operations / Workforce Orchestration / Agent Coordination

Primary Function: Represent, coordinate, supervise, and audit agentic workers (human, AI, and hybrid) and operational work—translating intent into executable tasks and outcomes—while remaining fully governed by GGP.

2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)

CWP exists to turn objectives into coordinated, accountable work by organizing agentic workers, tasks, roles, and performance signals into a governed operational plane that reliably executes day-to-day operations.

3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)

CWP may:

Model operational work as tasks, playbooks, workflows, and queues

Represent workers (humans, AI agents, hybrid teams) with roles, capabilities, and assignments

Coordinate execution of work across engines and systems (handoffs, dependencies, escalation)

Operate work supervision: checkpoints, status tracking, exception handling, and completion verification

Manage operational SOPs/playbooks (run steps, enforce required artifacts)

Maintain work performance signals (throughput, cycle time, quality markers)

Support approval routing and human-in-the-loop steps (as required by GGP)

Emit structured operational events for telemetry and audit correlation (to LUM and GGP)

CWP must NOT:

Create or override governance policy (GGP is the authority)

Operate as the financial ledger (FLO is the authority)

Act as a general data lake/warehouse (DRE/PIE own research/analytics)

4. Scope Boundaries & Interfaces

4.1 What CWP owns

Worker registry (agent profiles, capabilities, availability signals)

Task/work item system (queues, assignments, SLAs, escalation)

Workflow/playbook execution model (SOP steps, checklists, gating)

Operational supervision surfaces (dashboards, work states, exception inbox)

Work evidence capture for completion (artifacts, receipts, links, confirmations)

4.2 What CWP depends on

GGP: governance rules, approvals, constraints, evidence requirements

IDN: identity, roles, permissions, entity records (who is a worker/actor)

LUM: observability/telemetry correlation, incident signals, health of work execution

FLO: capital/ledger actions (CWP can request; FLO records and executes under GGP)

MUX: external system integrations (email, calendars, ticketing, vendor systems)

4.3 Common integration surfaces

GGP: evaluate decision gates before executing governed steps

IDN: resolve actor identity, role-based eligibility for tasks/approvals

LUM: emit work events and correlate with traces, incidents, and evidence bundles

FLO: submit governed requests for payments, reimbursements, procurement events

5. Core Concepts

5.1 Worker

A Worker is an actor capable of performing tasks.

Worker types

Human (employee/contractor)

AI Agent (software agent operating with bounded permissions)

Hybrid Unit (human + agent pair)

Key attributes

capabilities/skills

authorization profile (derived from IDN + GGP)

availability and load

5.2 Work Item

A Work Item is a unit of operational work tracked to completion.

Examples

triage inbox item

vendor follow-up

invoice verification

publish a post (handoff to CDE)

fulfill an order (handoff to DAT/FLO)

5.3 Playbook (SOP)

A Playbook is a structured sequence of steps that produces a consistent outcome.

Playbook steps can include

human actions

agent actions

external API calls (via MUX)

approvals (via GGP)

evidence collection (required artifacts)

5.4 Governance Gates

A Governance Gate is a required GGP decision/approval before proceeding.

Examples

spend threshold approval

releasing a customer-facing communication

modifying identity permissions

executing high-risk automation

5.5 Work Evidence

Work Evidence is proof that a task or step was completed correctly.

Examples

receipt PDF

signed approval

vendor confirmation email

screenshot/link to published artifact

6. Key Outputs / Deliverables

Canonical worker + task models

Queue-based operational execution plane

SOP/playbook library with governed gates

Human-in-the-loop approval routing (when required)

Standardized work event stream for correlation and audit

Operational dashboards: status, throughput, exceptions, SLA risk

7. Non-Goals

Replacing HRIS/payroll systems

Becoming a standalone project management product (unless later spun out)

Serving as the single source of truth for finances (FLO) or governance policy (GGP)

8. Risks & Mitigations

Over-automation risk → require GGP gates for material actions; default to human confirmation

Permission drift → IDN-backed roles; periodic access review via GGP policy

Task sprawl / unclear ownership → explicit queues, assignment rules, escalation ladders

Audit gaps → enforce required evidence and event emission for governed work

Alert fatigue → route operational signals to LUM with severity taxonomy

9. Initial Roadmap (MVP → v1)

MVP

Worker registry (humans + a small set of bounded AI agents)

Work item model + queues + assignment rules

Playbook runner (linear steps) with basic gating calls to GGP

Evidence attachment per work item

Event emission to LUM (work.started/work.completed/work.blocked)

v1

Advanced workflows (branching, retries, timeouts, escalations)

Delegation + coverage schedules

Performance signals (cycle time, quality markers, rework rate)

Tight integration with external systems via MUX (email/calendar/ticketing)

Built-in postmortem and continuous improvement loops (handoff to LUM + GGP)

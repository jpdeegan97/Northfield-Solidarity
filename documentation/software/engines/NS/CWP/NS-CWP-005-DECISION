Cognitive Work Plane (CWP)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework of the Cognitive Work Plane (CWP).
CWP decisions govern:
  how work is prioritized and assigned
  how agent eligibility is determined
  when work is escalated
  when reviews are required
  when work may be paused, reassigned, or closed
CWP decisions are operational and supervisory, not policy-setting or financial.
2. Decision Design Principles
 Bounded Authority — CWP never decides policy or executes actions
 Explainability — every decision produces a decision artifact
 Human Override — humans may override automated decisions
 Versioned Logic — decision rules evolve via explicit versions
 Governance Respect — decisions never bypass GGP constraints
3. Decision Classes
CWP defines six primary decision classes:
 Work Creation Decisions
 Assignment Decisions
 Scheduling Decisions
 Supervision Decisions
 Escalation Decisions
 Closure Decisions
Each decision emits a CWP Decision Artifact.
4. Work Creation Decisions
Question Answered:
Should this work artifact be created?
Inputs:
  triggering intent (strategy, research objective)
  governance constraints
  program scope
Outcomes:
  create task / mission / program
  reject creation
Creation decisions are usually human-initiated.
5. Assignment Decisions
Question Answered:
Which agent(s) should perform this work?
Inputs:
  agent capabilities
  trust level
  availability
  workload
  SLA urgency
Outcomes:
  assign agent
  defer assignment
  require human assignment
Assignments never occur without eligibility checks.
6. Scheduling Decisions
Question Answered:
When should this work execute?
Inputs:
  schedule definition
  dependencies
  system capacity
Outcomes:
  immediate execution
  delayed execution
  paused
7. Supervision Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this work proceeding acceptably?
Inputs:
  progress events
  heartbeat signals
  SLA timers
Outcomes:
  continue
  mark blocked
  trigger escalation
Supervision decisions are continuous.
8. Escalation Decisions
Question Answered:
Does this situation require intervention?
Triggers:
  SLA breach
  repeated failure
  risk threshold exceeded
  governance-required action
Outcomes:
  escalate to human
  escalate to program owner
  escalate to GGP
Escalations are never silent.
9. Closure Decisions
Question Answered:
Can this work be closed?
Inputs:
  completion signal
  review outcome
  unresolved escalations
Outcomes:
  close work
  reopen work
  archive
Work cannot close with open escalations.
10. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each CWP decision emits:
  decision_id
  decision_type
  work_ref
  inputs_summary
  outcome
  ruleset_version
  decided_at
  actor_id
Decision artifacts are append-only.
11. Automation vs Human Control
Decision Type

Human-Required
Assignment

Closure

Yes
Humans retain ultimate authority.
12. Failure Modes & Safeguards
  conflicting rules → human review
  missing inputs → defer decision
  governance conflict → escalate

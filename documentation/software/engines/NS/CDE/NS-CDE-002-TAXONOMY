NS-CDE-002 — TAXONOMY

0. Overview

This document defines the canonical taxonomy for CDE (Content Distribution Engine). The purpose is to standardize language for content packaging, distribution targets, scheduling, delivery events, and measurement—so that all engines (SIG/PIE/DRE/MUX/GGP/LUM) can integrate with CDE consistently.

1. Core Object Taxonomy

1.1 Content Object

A Content Object is the atomic unit of distributable material.

Common subclasses

Post (short-form social)

Article (long-form web/blog)

Email (newsletter or transactional)

Asset (image/video/pdf)

Listing (marketplace listing / product page)

Announcement (press/update)

Core properties

content_id (stable)

content_type (enum)

title / caption

body (rich text)

assets[] (references)

language / locale

tags[]

source_engine (PIE/SIG/DRE/etc.)

created_at / updated_at

1.2 Content Variant

A Content Variant is a transformation of a Content Object tailored for a channel.

Examples

Same product announcement as: LinkedIn post, X thread, email snippet, blog intro.

Core properties

variant_id

parent_content_id

channel_type

format_profile (character limits, media constraints)

rendered_payload (the final channel-specific payload)

1.3 Distribution Channel

A Distribution Channel is a category of destinations with shared constraints.

Examples

Social: X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok

Email: Mailchimp, SendGrid, Gmail (internal)

Web: CMS (WordPress/Webflow), static site deploy

Marketplace: Amazon/eBay/Etsy/Shopify

Messaging: Slack/Google Chat/Discord

Core properties

channel_type (enum)

provider

auth_profile

rate_limits

content_constraints

1.4 Destination

A Destination is a concrete endpoint within a channel.

Examples

A specific LinkedIn company page

A specific email list

A specific site/blog section

A specific marketplace storefront

Core properties

destination_id

channel_type

provider_account_id

destination_locator (page_id, list_id, site_id, storefront_id)

default_policy_set_id

1.5 Audience

An Audience defines who receives or can see distributed content.

Audience forms

Explicit list (email list, user IDs)

Rule-based segment (attributes/behavior)

Public (social/web)

Core properties

audience_id

audience_type (list/segment/public)

definition (rules or references)

1.6 Campaign

A Campaign is an organizing container for related content and deliveries.

Examples

Product launch campaign

Weekly newsletter cycle

Seasonal promo campaign

Core properties

campaign_id

objective (awareness/conversion/retention)

budget (optional)

start_at / end_at

kpis[]

1.7 Distribution Plan

A Distribution Plan maps content (and variants) to destinations, audiences, and schedules.

Core properties

plan_id

campaign_id (optional)

content_id / variant_ids[]

targets[] (destinations + audiences)

schedule

policy_requirements

1.8 Schedule

A Schedule defines timing and recurrence.

Schedule types

One-shot: publish at timestamp

Window: publish within time window

Recurring: cron-like recurrence

Triggered: publish when an event occurs

Core properties

schedule_type

run_at / window_start / window_end

rrule / cron expression (if recurring)

trigger_event_type (if triggered)

1.9 Policy Set (Governance)

A Policy Set is a collection of governance constraints required before distribution.

Examples

Approvals required for public posts

Brand compliance checks

Restricted keywords / regulated claims

Materiality thresholds tied to spend/boosting

Core properties

policy_set_id

constraints[]

required_approvals[]

evidence_requirements[]

GGP remains the authority; CDE only references and enforces the required gates.

2. Execution & Delivery Taxonomy

2.1 Distribution Job

A Distribution Job is the runnable unit created from a plan at execution time.

Core properties

job_id

plan_id

destination_id

variant_id

state

attempt_count

idempotency_key

2.2 Delivery Attempt

A Delivery Attempt is one try to publish/send to a destination.

Core properties

attempt_id

job_id

provider_request_id

status_code / error_code

started_at / ended_at

2.3 Delivery Receipt

A Delivery Receipt is provider-confirmed delivery metadata.

Examples

Post URL / message ID / email campaign ID

Core properties

receipt_id

job_id

provider_object_id

provider_permalink

delivered_at

2.4 States

Plan state

draft → ready → scheduled → executing → completed | cancelled

Job state

queued → running → delivered | failed | blocked

Block reasons (examples)

awaiting_approval

missing_evidence

policy_violation

quota_exceeded

3. Events & Signals

3.1 CDE Event

Canonical event types emitted by CDE.

Planning events

plan.created, plan.updated, plan.scheduled, plan.cancelled

Governance events

job.blocked.awaiting_approval

job.blocked.policy_violation

job.unblocked

Delivery events

job.queued, job.started, job.delivered, job.failed

attempt.started, attempt.failed, attempt.succeeded

Provider callback events

provider.webhook.received

provider.delivery.confirmed

Event envelope (minimum)

event_id, event_type, occurred_at

campaign_id, plan_id, job_id

content_id, variant_id

destination_id, channel_type, provider

entity_id (if tied to IDN entity)

decision_id (if gated by GGP)

trace_id / workflow_id (for LUM correlation)

4. Measurement Taxonomy

4.1 Metrics

Delivery metrics

delivered_count, failed_count, retry_count

time_to_deliver

Engagement metrics (channel dependent)

impressions, reach, clicks, CTR

likes/reactions, comments, shares

opens, unsubscribes (email)

Conversion metrics

conversions, conversion_rate

attributed_revenue (if available)

4.2 Attribution

Attribution models supported (select per campaign)

last-touch

first-touch

multi-touch (weighted)

none/unknown

5. Integration Taxonomy

5.1 Provider Connector

A Provider Connector is an adapter implementing a channel provider.

Common connector capabilities

auth/refresh

create/update/publish

delete/rollback (where allowed)

webhook verification

rate-limit handling

5.2 External Integration ID

Every external provider binding must have a stable Integration ID.

Examples

EXT-LINKEDIN-PUBLISH

EXT-X-PUBLISH

EXT-GOOGLE-SEARCHCONSOLE

6. Security & Compliance Terms

Redaction: removal/masking of sensitive fields before storage/logging.

Least privilege: minimal scopes required per destination/provider.

Evidence: artifacts required by GGP for governed distribution (approvals, brand checks).

Idempotency: guarantee a publish action executes once even under retries.

7. Canonical Enums (Starter)

content_type: post | article | email | asset | listing | announcement

channel_type: social | email | web | marketplace | messaging

schedule_type: one_shot | window | recurring | triggered

job_state: queued | running | delivered | failed | blocked

block_reason: awaiting_approval | missing_evidence | policy_violation | quota_exceeded | auth_failed

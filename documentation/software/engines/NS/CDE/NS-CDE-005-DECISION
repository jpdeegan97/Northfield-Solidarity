Content Distribution Engine (CDE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework for the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
CDE decisions are narrowly scoped to:
distribution execution correctness
idempotent retry behavior
scheduling, throttling, and failure escalation
proof validation and feedback classification
CDE does not decide strategy, content meaning, pricing, or governance approvals.
2. Decision Design Principles
Bounded Authority — CDE decides distribution operations, not business intent
Idempotency First — all decisions respect dedupe guarantees
Explainability — every decision emits a rationale artifact
Safety Over Speed — uncertain cases escalate instead of guessing
Governance Respect — approval state is a hard gate
3. Decision Classes
CDE defines seven primary decision classes:
Plan Admission Decisions
Release Eligibility Decisions (Governance Gate)
Scheduling & Dispatch Decisions
Retry / Backoff Decisions
Escalation Decisions
Proof Validation Decisions
Feedback Classification Decisions
Each decision produces an immutable decision artifact.
4. Plan Admission Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this distribution plan structurally valid and admissible?
Inputs:
content reference integrity
destination validity
required constraints present
Outcomes:
accept draft
reject (validation error)
defer (missing upstream references)
5. Release Eligibility Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this plan eligible for execution at this moment?
Inputs:
governance approval state (GGP)
time window
actor authority
Outcomes:
eligible → create intent
blocked → no intent
expired → archive
6. Scheduling & Dispatch Decisions
Question Answered:
When and how should execution attempts be dispatched?
Inputs:
schedule policy
per-channel concurrency limits
historical error rates
Outcomes:
dispatch now
defer
throttle
7. Retry / Backoff Decisions
Question Answered:
Should a failed attempt be retried, and with what backoff?
Inputs:
error category (transient vs permanent)
destination characteristics
retry count
idempotency key presence
Outcomes:
retry with backoff
stop retry (permanent)
escalate
Backoff is policy-driven and versioned.
8. Escalation Decisions
Question Answered:
Does this failure require operator or governance intervention?
Triggers:
repeated failures
suspected duplication
credential failures
policy violations
Outcomes:
notify operator
open incident
require governance review
9. Proof Validation Decisions
Question Answered:
Is the returned proof sufficient to assert successful delivery?
Inputs:
adapter response
proof type requirements per channel
Outcomes:
accept proof
mark insufficient (requires reconciliation)
Proof acceptance is deterministic.
10. Feedback Classification Decisions
Question Answered:
How should downstream feedback be classified and forwarded?
Inputs:
feedback payload
destination
signal type
Outcomes:
performance signal → SIG
rejection/quality issue → operator queue
anomaly → incident
11. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each CDE decision emits an immutable artifact containing:
decision_id (UUID)
decision_type
subject_ref (plan_id / intent_id / attempt_id)
outcome
rationale (structured JSON)
ruleset_name
ruleset_version
evaluated_at (UTC)
correlation_id
12. Governance Interaction
CDE decisions integrate with governance by:
checking GGP approval state before execution
recording governance_ref on release decisions
escalating policy violations for review
CDE never self-approves releases.
13. Failure Modes & Safeguards
ambiguous proof → do not mark success
idempotency uncertainty → stop and escalate
credential failure → stop retries
CDE favors correctness and auditability.

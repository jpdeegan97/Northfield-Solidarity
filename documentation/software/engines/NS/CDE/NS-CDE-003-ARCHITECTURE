Content Distribution Engine (CDE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the logical and operational architecture of the Content Distribution Engine (CDE).
The architecture is designed to:
execute governed distribution plans safely
fan out content to multiple channels via adapters
provide idempotent, retryable execution
capture delivery proof and feedback
support audit, replay, and observability
2. Architectural Principles
Plan–Execute Separation — intent is isolated from execution mechanics
Adapter Isolation — channel logic lives behind MUX adapters
Idempotent Execution — retries never create duplicates
Governance First — no execution without approval state
Observable by Default — every attempt is logged and traceable
3. High-Level Architecture
CDE is composed of seven logical layers:
Plan Intake & Validation
Governance Gate
Intent Orchestration
Execution Dispatcher
Channel Adapter Interface (via MUX)
Proof & Feedback Capture
Event Ledger & Read Models
4. Plan Intake & Validation Layer
Responsibilities:
accept distribution plans from upstream engines
validate content references and destinations
ensure schema correctness and constraint completeness
Invalid plans are rejected before governance.
5. Governance Gate
Responsibilities:
verify approval state via GGP
ensure actor authority and scope
block unapproved or expired plans
The governance gate is a hard stop; execution cannot bypass it.
6. Intent Orchestration Layer
Responsibilities:
materialize distribution intents
expand plans into per-destination intents
record triggering context (actor, reason, time)
An intent is immutable once created.
7. Execution Dispatcher
Responsibilities:
schedule execution attempts
manage concurrency and backoff
ensure idempotency per destination
Execution state machine:
pending → running → success / failed → retried
8. Channel Adapter Interface (MUX)
Responsibilities:
translate generic distribution requests into channel-specific API calls
normalize responses and errors
CDE never embeds channel logic directly.
9. Proof & Feedback Capture
Responsibilities:
persist delivery proofs (IDs, URLs, receipts)
ingest platform feedback
forward performance signals to SIG
Proofs are immutable artifacts.
10. Event Ledger & Read Models
Responsibilities:
record all distribution events append-only
build read-optimized views for operators and auditors
Events include:
PlanApproved
IntentCreated
AttemptStarted
AttemptSucceeded
AttemptFailed
11. Storage Strategy
Authoritative stores:
PostgreSQL for plans, intents, attempts, proofs, events
Optional stores:
Kafka for execution and feedback events
Redis for hot execution state
12. Failure & Retry Architecture
transient failures → retry with backoff
permanent failures → mark failed, require intervention
retries are idempotent per (content, destination)
13. Security & Governance Boundaries
execution requires governance approval
adapter credentials managed externally
actor attribution recorded for every action
14. Observability
Metrics:
attempts per channel
success/failure rates
retry counts
Logs:
correlation_id
plan_id / intent_id / attempt_id

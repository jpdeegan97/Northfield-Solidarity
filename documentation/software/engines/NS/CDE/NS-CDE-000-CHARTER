NSDC Engine Charter — CDE (Content Distribution Engine)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Content Distribution Engine
Acronym: CDE
Engine Type: Distribution / Publishing / Engagement
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to manage, orchestrate, and distribute content across multiple platforms and channels, ensuring consistent messaging, optimized engagement, and alignment with NSDC strategy.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Orchestrate and publish content across multiple channels (social, marketplaces, newsletters, etc.)
  Schedule and optimize distribution based on engagement metrics
  Track performance, reach, and engagement of content
  Integrate with intelligence engines (PIE, SIG) for content targeting
  Maintain historical content archives and distribution logs
  Provide feedback to planning and governance layers
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Execute trades or arbitrage opportunities (DAT)
  Govern capital or compliance policies (GGP)
  Generate canonical product intelligence (PIE)
  Maintain financial ledgers (FLO)
  Integrate marketplaces beyond content deployment (MUX)
  Simulate scenarios or forecast financial performance (SIM)
CDE is strictly responsible for content distribution and engagement tracking.

7. Authority & Decision Rights
CDE May Decide Autonomously:
  Scheduling and sequencing of content distribution
  Optimizing delivery timing based on engagement metrics
  Selecting platform-specific formatting or presentation
CDE Must Not Decide:
  Capital deployment or execution
  Product intelligence or arbitrage strategy
  Governance policy enforcement beyond content compliance
  Simulation or forecasting beyond content metrics
CDE is a distribution and engagement engine only.
8. Governance & Constraints
  All content distribution must comply with GGP rules
  Approval workflows must be enforced for sensitive content
  Logs must be maintained for all published actions
  Engagement and performance tracking must be accurate and verifiable
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  Content delivery failures or delays
  Misformatted or incomplete content
  Tracking and engagement reporting inconsistencies
Worst-Case Failure:
  Missed campaigns, low engagement, or incorrect content delivery
  Minor reputational impact if errors are external-facing
Blast Radius:
  Primarily impacts audience engagement and downstream intelligence (PIE, SIG)
  No direct financial or capital impact
Containment strategy:
  Retry and fallback distribution mechanisms
  Logging and alerting of failures
  Versioned content archives for restoration
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Engagement, reach, and content effectiveness
  Time Horizon: Real-time for immediate campaigns, near real-time for scheduled distribution
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  Content assets and media files
  Audience and targeting signals (SIG / PIE)
  Distribution channels and APIs (MUX)
  Governance flags and approval workflows (GGP)
  Engagement metrics and reporting schema
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Content orchestration and publishing across 2–3 primary channels
  Engagement tracking and reporting
  Historical content archives
  Integration with PIE and SIG for targeting signals
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive content optimization beyond initial metrics
  Execution of financial or product strategy
  Integration with all marketplaces beyond content channels
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Core content publishing and engagement tracking
  Phase 2: Multi-channel optimization and audience targeting
  Phase 3: Predictive content optimization and automated campaign orchestration

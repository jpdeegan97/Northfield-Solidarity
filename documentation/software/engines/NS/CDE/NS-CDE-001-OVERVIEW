Content Distribution Engine (CDE)
1. Purpose
The Content Distribution Engine (CDE) is responsible for controlled, auditable, and optimized distribution of content artifacts across internal and external channels.
CDE exists to answer a single operational question:
What content should be distributed, where, when, and under what constraints — and can we prove it happened correctly?
CDE ensures that content movement is intentional, governed, observable, and replayable.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
CDE sits at the execution-adjacent distribution layer of the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
It bridges:
PIE / DRE — content and insight generation
GGP — governance, approval, and audit
MUX — channel integration and protocol translation
And delivers to:
external platforms (marketplaces, media, partners)
internal systems (dashboards, archives, knowledge bases)
CDE does not create content or decide strategy; it executes governed distribution plans.
3. What CDE Produces
CDE produces Distribution Artifacts, including:
distribution plans (what/where/when)
execution records (attempts, outcomes)
delivery proofs (IDs, URLs, receipts)
performance feedback signals
All artifacts are:
versioned
auditable
attributable to actors and entities
4. What CDE Does Not Do
To maintain clean boundaries, CDE does not:
generate content (PIE, DRE)
decide whether content should be published (GGP)
manage channel credentials (IDN / secure vaults)
optimize pricing or bids (DAT)
CDE distributes; others decide and optimize.
5. Core Capabilities
Distribution Planning
Encode where, when, and how content should be distributed.
Channel-Oriented Execution
Execute distribution via channel adapters (MUX-backed).
Governed Release Controls
Ensure content is only released after approvals.
Delivery Verification
Capture proof-of-distribution artifacts.
Feedback Capture
Ingest downstream performance signals.
6. Content Classes
CDE handles multiple content classes:
listings (product, property)
media (images, video)
documents (reports, disclosures)
signals (alerts, notifications)
metadata updates
Content meaning is opaque to CDE; only structure and constraints matter.
7. Interaction With Other Engines
Engine
Relationship to CDE
PIE
Supplies content insights
DRE
Supplies research artifacts
GGP
Governs release and audit
MUX
Executes channel-specific delivery
DAT
Adjusts strategy based on outcomes
SIG
Feeds performance signals
IDN
Resolves actor/entity attribution
CWP
Schedules and supervises execution
8. Operational Posture
CDE is:
Write-controlled (governed plans)
Execution-heavy (fan-out delivery)
Idempotent (safe retries)
Replayable (distribution attempts can be re-run)
9. Expected Outcomes
When CDE is functioning correctly:
content reaches intended destinations reliably
releases are provably governed
failures are visible and recoverable
downstream engines learn from distribution performance
CDE reduces chaos, not creativity.

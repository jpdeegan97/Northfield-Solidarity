Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This runbook defines production-grade operational procedures for bringing up, validating, operating, and troubleshooting the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
DRE operations prioritize:
  evidence immutability
  provenance and attribution
  versioned research evolution
  governance-gated promotion
2. Operational Invariants (Never Violate)
Operators must never:
  overwrite or delete evidence items
  “edit” historical hypothesis or narrative versions
  backdate captured evidence timestamps
  promote research downstream without governance approval
  modify promotion snapshots after approval
All corrections happen via new evidence, new versions, and new decisions.
3. Startup Procedure
3.1 Preflight Checks
 PostgreSQL reachable (read/write)
 DB migrations applied
 Object storage (if used) reachable
 Kafka (if used) reachable
 GGP reachable (promotion approvals)
 Downstream targets reachable (PIE/SIM/DAT) OR queued mode enabled
 Observability stack reachable (logs/metrics)
 Secrets present (worker identities, credentials)
If GGP is down → run DRE in research-only mode (no promotions).
3.2 Startup Order
 PostgreSQL
 dre-api
 dre-ingest-worker
 dre-synth-worker (optional in MVP)
 dre-promotion
 dre-projector (optional)
4. Normal Operations
4.1 Source Registry Operations
Checklist when registering a source:
  source type and expected cadence
  credibility and bias notes
  allowed capture methods
Common actions:
  pause noisy or unstable sources
  retire deprecated sources
4.2 Evidence Ingestion Operations
Manual ingestion checklist:
  correct source_id
  capture_method recorded
  fingerprint produced
  captured_at uses UTC
Worker ingestion checklist:
  rate limits respected
  backoff on failures
  dedupe enforced by fingerprint
Rule: evidence items are immutable.
4.3 Evidence Triage & Linking
Evidence Inbox flow:
 tag evidence
 link to themes/hypotheses (create citations)
 park irrelevant evidence (do not delete)
If evidence is sensitive:
  ensure access tiering policies apply
4.4 Hypothesis Operations
When updating hypotheses:
  confirm new evidence is cited
  create a new hypothesis_version
  record change summary
  create a decision artifact referencing ruleset_version
If contradictory evidence appears:
  route to reviewer queue
4.5 Narrative Operations
Narrative acceptance checklist:
  coverage check: major claims have citations
  scope matches referenced hypotheses
  reviewer notes recorded
Accepted narratives:
  are immutable
  may be superseded by new accepted versions
5. Promotion Operations (Governed)
5.1 Promotion Preparation
Before submitting promotion:
  specify artifact_id + artifact_version
  confirm narrative acceptance (if required)
  attach rationale
5.2 Promotion Submission
  submit promotion request
  request sent to GGP
  DRE waits for approval outcome
5.3 Approval Outcomes
  approved → create promotion snapshot and publish
  rejected → keep internal; revise and resubmit
If downstream is unavailable:
  publish to an outbox/queue
  retry until delivered
6. Projection & Reporting Operations
If dashboards are stale:
 verify event ledger ingestion
 rebuild projections
 validate counts:
  evidence captured/day
  hypotheses by state
  promotions by status
Projections are derived; never hand-edit.
7. Incident Response Playbooks
7.1 Evidence Ingestion Backlog Growing
Actions:
 inspect worker health
 check source rate limits
 scale ingest workers
 pause non-critical sources
7.2 Duplicate Evidence Flood
Actions:
 verify fingerprinting correctness
 confirm source changes are detected as new evidence (if desired)
 adjust normalization rules
7.3 Promotion Pipeline Blocked
Actions:
 check GGP availability
 verify actor permissions
 inspect rejected rationale
 queue promotions for later if governance outage
7.4 Contradictory Evidence Spike
Actions:
 route hypotheses to reviewer queue
 temporarily suspend promotions for affected themes
 publish caution note to downstream consumers
8. Backup & Disaster Recovery
8.1 PostgreSQL Restore
Steps:
  restore DB
  validate FK integrity
  rebuild projections
8.2 Evidence Payload Restore
If object storage used:
  restore referenced blobs
  verify evidence_id → object links
8.3 Replay
  rebuild state from event ledger
  verify hypothesis version timelines
9. Change Management
  schema changes are additive
  decision ruleset changes are versioned
  synthesis logic changes should be replay-tested
  promotion contracts must remain backward compatible

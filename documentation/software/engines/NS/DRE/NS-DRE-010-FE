Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the optional frontend (FE) / operator UI for the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
The DRE Operator UI exists to:
  register sources and configure monitoring
  ingest and review evidence
  create and curate themes and hypotheses
  manage confidence updates and reviewer notes
  draft and accept research narratives
  submit governed promotion requests to downstream engines
  export research briefs and evidence packs
DRE FE is a research workbench: capture → synthesize → promote.
2. FE Design Principles
 Evidence First — evidence capture and citation are primary
 Human-in-the-Loop — suggestions are explicit; acceptance is deliberate
 Version Transparency — artifact versions and changes are visible
 Provenance Clarity — every claim shows its evidence chain
 Governed Promotion — promotion actions are guarded
3. Primary Personas
  Research Operator — collects evidence, curates themes/hypotheses
  Reviewer — validates narratives and confidence updates
  Governance Reviewer — approves promotion (via GGP workflow)
  Downstream Consumer — reads briefs and pulls artifacts (PIE/SIM/DAT)
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Research Dashboard
Purpose: global view of research state.
Widgets:
  active themes
  hypotheses by state (open/supported/contradicted)
  recently captured evidence
  pending reviews
  promotion requests (submitted/approved/rejected)
4.2 Source Registry
Features:
  add/edit sources
  source type and credibility notes
  monitoring cadence
  last_seen / last_ingested
Actions:
  enable/disable monitoring
  run ingest now (guarded)
4.3 Evidence Inbox
Purpose: triage new evidence.
Features:
  evidence list with filters (source, date, tags)
  diff view for changed pages (optional)
  dedupe indicator (fingerprint match)
Actions:
  tag evidence
  link evidence to theme/hypothesis (creates citation)
  mark as irrelevant / park in backlog
4.4 Evidence Detail
Displays:
  captured payload
  source metadata
  fingerprint
  citations referencing this evidence
Actions:
  add citation context notes
  request reviewer attention
4.5 Theme Explorer
Features:
  browse themes/subthemes
  theme timelines
  linked hypotheses
  linked narratives
Actions:
  create theme
  edit theme (new version)
4.6 Hypothesis Workbench
Features:
  hypothesis list with confidence + state
  version history view (diff)
  supporting vs counter evidence panels
Actions:
  create hypothesis
  propose confidence update (creates decision draft)
  accept update (creates new version)
4.7 Narrative Builder
Features:
  narrative editor with citation insertion
  coverage checklist (claims must cite evidence)
  narrative version history
Actions:
  submit narrative for review
  accept narrative (locks version)
4.8 Review Queue
Purpose: structured review workflow.
Items:
  narratives pending acceptance
  confidence update proposals
  contradiction alerts
Actions:
  approve / request changes
  attach reviewer notes (append-only)
4.9 Promotion Center
Purpose: prepare and submit promotion requests.
Features:
  select artifact + version
  select target engine (PIE/SIM/DAT)
  attach rationale
  preview “promotion snapshot”
Actions:
  submit promotion request (guarded)
  view governance status (approved/rejected)
4.10 Briefs & Evidence Packs
Purpose: exportable research outputs.
Exports:
  theme brief
  hypothesis evidence pack
  promotion snapshot pack
Formats:
  JSON bundle
  PDF brief
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
  SourceTable
  SourceMonitorControls
  EvidenceTable
  EvidenceDetailPane
  TagEditor
  CitationLinker
  ThemeTree
  HypothesisList
  HypothesisVersionDiff
  EvidenceSupportCounterPanel
  ConfidenceUpdateModal
  NarrativeEditor
  CitationPicker
  ReviewQueue
  PromotionRequestWizard
  BriefExporter
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
Read:
  sources list/detail
  evidence list/detail
  citations by artifact/evidence
  themes list/detail
  hypotheses list/detail + version history
  narratives list/detail + version history
  promotion requests + governance state
Write (guarded):
  register/update sources
  ingest evidence (manual)
  create citations
  create hypothesis / update confidence (new version)
  create narrative / accept narrative version
  submit promotion request
7. Non-Functional Requirements
  strong search/filter across sources and evidence
  fast citation navigation (artifact ↔ evidence)
  clear version and diff visualization
  role-based access controls on promotions and acceptance

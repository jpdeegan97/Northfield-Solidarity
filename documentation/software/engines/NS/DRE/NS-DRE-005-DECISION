Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the decision framework used within the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
DRE decisions govern:
  how evidence is interpreted
  how confidence is updated
  when hypotheses change state
  when research is eligible for promotion
DRE decisions are epistemic, not operational or financial.
2. Decision Design Principles
 Evidence-Grounded — every decision references evidence
 Explicit Uncertainty — confidence changes are visible and reasoned
 Human-Supervised — agents assist, humans retain authority
 Versioned Logic — decision rules are versioned and replayable
 Governance-Gated Promotion — downstream usage requires approval
3. Decision Classes
DRE defines six primary decision classes:
 Evidence Relevance Decisions
 Hypothesis State Decisions
 Confidence Update Decisions
 Narrative Acceptance Decisions
 Promotion Eligibility Decisions
 Deprecation Decisions
Each decision produces an immutable decision artifact.
4. Evidence Relevance Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this evidence relevant to an existing theme or hypothesis?
Inputs:
  evidence content
  tagging heuristics
  reviewer notes
Outcomes:
  link to artifact
  store as unlinked evidence
5. Hypothesis State Decisions
Question Answered:
Should the hypothesis state change?
States:
  open
  supported
  contradicted
  retired
Inputs:
  cumulative supporting evidence
  counter-evidence
  confidence thresholds
6. Confidence Update Decisions
Question Answered:
How confident are we in this hypothesis?
Inputs:
  quantity and quality of evidence
  source credibility
  recency
Outcomes:
  numeric confidence update
  rationale record
Confidence updates never delete prior values.
7. Narrative Acceptance Decisions
Question Answered:
Is this narrative ready to be treated as canonical?
Inputs:
  narrative completeness
  citation coverage
  reviewer approval
Outcomes:
  accept
  revise
  reject
8. Promotion Eligibility Decisions
Question Answered:
Can this research be promoted downstream?
Inputs:
  hypothesis confidence
  evidence coverage
  narrative acceptance
Outcomes:
  eligible for promotion request
  not eligible
Promotion still requires GGP approval.
9. Deprecation Decisions
Question Answered:
Should this research artifact be deprecated?
Triggers:
  contradictory evidence
  obsolescence
  scope change
Outcomes:
  mark deprecated
  retain for historical reference
10. Decision Artifact Schema (Logical)
Each DRE decision emits:
  decision_id
  decision_type
  artifact_ref
  outcome
  rationale
  ruleset_version
  decided_at
  actor_id
11. Governance Interaction
  promotion eligibility feeds GGP workflows
  GGP approval required for downstream exposure
  rejected promotions remain internal to DRE
12. Failure Modes & Safeguards
  insufficient evidence → no promotion
  conflicting evidence → human review required
  stale research → confidence decay or deprecation

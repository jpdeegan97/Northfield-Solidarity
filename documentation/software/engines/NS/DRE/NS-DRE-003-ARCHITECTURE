Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the architecture of the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
It describes:
  major components and services
  data flow between ingestion, synthesis, and promotion
  interaction with other Northfield Solidarity engines
  design choices that ensure provenance, replayability, and governance
2. Architectural Principles
 Evidence-Centric Design — all claims originate from evidence
 Append-Only Knowledge Graph — history is never erased
 Human + Agent Collaboration — agents assist, humans curate
 Governed Promotion — downstream usage is explicitly approved
 Replayable Research — syntheses can be reconstructed
3. High-Level Architecture
DRE is composed of five logical layers:
 Collection & Ingestion Layer
 Evidence Store & Knowledge Graph
 Synthesis & Reasoning Layer
 Governance & Promotion Layer
 Query & Export Layer
4. Component Breakdown
4.1 Collection & Ingestion Layer
Responsibilities:
  crawl, scrape, and ingest sources
  accept manual uploads and notes
  timestamp and fingerprint evidence
Components:
  source monitors
  crawler/agent workers
  manual ingest API
Outputs immutable Evidence Items.
4.2 Evidence Store & Knowledge Graph
Responsibilities:
  persist evidence, citations, entities, and relationships
  maintain temporal and confidence annotations
  serve as canonical research memory
Storage:
  relational store for artifacts
  graph store or graph overlay for relationships
4.3 Synthesis & Reasoning Layer
Responsibilities:
  cluster evidence into themes and subthemes
  maintain hypotheses and confidence updates
  generate research narratives
Components:
  hypothesis manager
  confidence updater
  narrative composer (human or agent-assisted)
4.4 Governance & Promotion Layer
Responsibilities:
  manage promotion requests
  integrate with GGP for approval
  version research artifacts
No research flows downstream without approval.
4.5 Query & Export Layer
Responsibilities:
  serve structured queries to PIE, SIM, DAT
  export research briefs and evidence packs
  support audit and replay
5. Data Flow Overview
 Sources change or are discovered
 Evidence is ingested and stored immutably
 Citations link evidence to artifacts
 Hypotheses update confidence
 Narratives are produced
 Promotion requests are submitted
 GGP approves or rejects promotion
 Approved artifacts flow downstream
6. Cross-Engine Integration
Engine
Interaction
SIG
Seeds research threads with signals
PIE
Consumes themes, hypotheses, narratives
SIM
Consumes assumptions and drivers
DAT
Consumes sourcing and constraint research
GGP
Governs promotion and versioning
IDN
Provides entity and actor resolution
CWP
Schedules agentic research programs
7. Deployment Topology (Logical)
  DRE API service
  ingestion workers (scalable)
  synthesis workers
  promotion coordinator
  read-only query service
Components may be deployed independently.
8. Failure & Degradation Modes
  ingestion outage → synthesis continues
  governance outage → promotion paused
  query outage → research continues
Evidence capture is prioritized over synthesis.
9. Security & Access Control
  evidence write access restricted
  promotion actions require actor attribution
  read access tiered by role

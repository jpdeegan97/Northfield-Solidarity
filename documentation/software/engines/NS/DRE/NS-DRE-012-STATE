Deep Research Engine (DRE)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the state model and state transition semantics for the Deep Research Engine (DRE).
It formalizes how research artifacts move through explicit states while preserving:
  evidence provenance
  versioned evolution
  governance gating
  replay and audit integrity
2. State Design Principles
 Evidence Is Stateless but Immutable — evidence does not transition; artifacts do
 Explicit Lifecycle States — no implicit or inferred transitions
 Versioned Transitions — state changes produce new versions
 Human Authority — acceptance and promotion require human action
 Governance as a Gate — downstream exposure requires approval
3. Primary State Domains
DRE maintains the following state domains:
 Source State
 Evidence State (logical)
 Theme State
 Hypothesis State
 Narrative State
 Promotion Request State
 Review Queue State
4. Source State
Sources represent monitored origins of information.
States:
  registered
  active
  paused
  deprecated
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger
registered

monitoring enabled

operator resume

deprecated
source retired
5. Evidence State (Logical)
Evidence items are immutable and do not transition.
Logical processing states (tracked via metadata):
  captured
  triaged
  linked
  parked
These do not mutate evidence records.
6. Theme State
Themes evolve slowly and represent research domains.
States:
  draft
  active
  declining
  archived
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger
draft
active
accepted by reviewer

declining
sustained negative evidence

archived
no longer relevant
7. Hypothesis State
Hypotheses are versioned claims.
States:
  open
  supported
  contradicted
  retired
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger
open
supported
confidence ≥ threshold
open
contradicted
strong counter-evidence

new disconfirming evidence
any
retired
scope change / obsolescence
Each transition creates a new hypothesis_version.
8. Narrative State
Narratives are human-readable syntheses.
States:
  draft
  in_review
  accepted
  superseded
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger
draft
in_review
submit for review
in_review
accepted
reviewer approval

new accepted version
Accepted narratives are immutable.
9. Promotion Request State
Promotion requests govern downstream exposure.
States:
  draft
  submitted
  approved
  rejected
  expired
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger

10. Review Queue State
Review items coordinate human validation.
States:
  pending
  in_review
  changes_requested
  approved
  closed
Transitions:
From
To
Trigger
pending
in_review
reviewer claims

11. Cross-State Invariants
  evidence is never deleted or altered
  state transitions always create versioned artifacts
  accepted narratives reference specific hypothesis versions
  promotions reference immutable snapshots
12. Event Emission
Every state transition emits an event:
  dre.source.state_changed
  dre.hypothesis.version_created
  dre.narrative.accepted
  dre.promotion.submitted
  dre.promotion.approved
Events are append-only.

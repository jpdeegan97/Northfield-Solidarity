Deep Research Engine (DRE)
Documentation Master Plan (Aligned to NS-GGP Canonical Template)
PurposeThis document defines the authoritative documentation master plan for DRE, strictly aligned to the existing NS-GGP document structure (000–014).
DRE is the long-horizon, deep synthesis research engine for Northfield Solidarity. It is designed to explore complex domains over time, connect weak signals, map emerging trends, and generate structured research artifacts rather than immediate execution opportunities.
DRE complements PIE:
PIE = fast, market-facing, opportunity-oriented
DRE = slow, deep, exploratory, systems-oriented
DRE does not execute actions (DAT), publish content (CDE), or govern approvals (GGP).

DRE Documentation Index (Canonical)

NS-DRE-000 — CHARTER
Purpose: Define why DRE exists
Scope:
Mission of DRE
Why deep research must be separated from execution
DRE’s role in long-term strategy and discovery
Explicit non-goals (execution, governance, rapid arbitrage)
Mirrors: NS-GGP-000

NS-DRE-001 — OVERVIEW
Purpose: High-level conceptual framing
Scope:
What DRE produces (research graphs, thematic maps, hypotheses)
Difference between DRE outputs and PIE insights
Primary consumers: GGP, PIE, SIG, human operators
Mirrors: NS-GGP-001

NS-DRE-002 — TAXONOMY
Purpose: Define DRE’s atomic research concepts
Scope:
Research Topic
Source Corpus
Hypothesis
Finding
Research Graph
Confidence Annotation
Mirrors: NS-GGP-002

NS-DRE-003 — ARCHITECTURE
Purpose: Logical deep research architecture
Scope:

Cross-Engine Dependencies
DRE integrates with but does not own:
SIG — raw signal feeds
PIE — downstream insight extraction
GGP — governance over actionability
CDE — research publication (if externalized)

Completion Criteria
DRE documentation is complete when:
NS-DRE-000 → NS-DRE-014 exist
Research artifacts are reproducible and explainable
Long-horizon insights do not leak into execution without governance

NS-DRE-015B — Research Artifact Engine (RAE)

EEE & IMPL Specification

Engine: Deep Research Engine (DRE)Extends: DRE-015 — Research Artifact EngineDocument Type: Execution, Events & ImplementationVersion: 1.0Status: Canonical

1. Purpose

This document defines the execution semantics, event model, and implementation guidance for the Research Artifact Engine (RAE).

NS-DRE-015B specifies how Research Artifacts are executed, updated, vectorized, and published in a deterministic, auditable, and scalable manner.

2. Execution Model (EEE)

2.1 Artifact-Centric Execution

RAE operates on a single primary unit of execution: the Research Artifact (RA).

All research activity, synthesis, documentation, and vectorization is scoped to an Artifact ID.

Execution is:

Deterministic

Idempotent per lifecycle phase

Append-only with respect to state history

2.2 Execution Triggers

RAE execution may be triggered by:

Artifact creation (INIT)

Manual scope update

Scheduled refresh (time-based)

Signal ingestion (event-based)

Drift detection threshold breach

Explicit re-synthesis request

Each trigger results in a bounded lifecycle re-entry, not a full restart.

2.3 Phase-Level Executors

Each lifecycle phase is handled by a dedicated executor:

Phase

Executor Responsibility

INIT

Identity + metadata creation

SCOPE

Boundary validation and normalization

DISCOVER

Source querying and signal ingestion

SYNTHESIZE

Pattern extraction and reconciliation

FORMALIZE

Structured state + doc generation

VECTORIZE

Multi-layer embedding generation

PUBLISH

State exposure + event emission

MONITOR

Drift evaluation and trigger generation

Executors are composable and replaceable.

3. Event Model (EEE)

3.1 Core Event Types

RAE emits strongly-typed domain events:

ArtifactCreated

ScopeDefined

DiscoveryCompleted

SynthesisCompleted

FormalizationCompleted

VectorizationCompleted

ArtifactPublished

DriftDetected

ArtifactInvalidated

Events are immutable and ordered per Artifact ID.

3.2 Event Payload Structure

event_id: UUID
artifact_id: UUID
event_type: enum
lifecycle_state: enum
timestamp: ISO-8601
payload: object

Events are the source of truth for state transitions.

3.3 Downstream Consumers

RAE events are consumed by:

PIE (reasoning + execution)

Monitoring / observability systems

Governance / approval layers (future GGP binding)

Audit and replay systems

4. State Assembly & Persistence

4.1 State Composition

ArtifactState is assembled incrementally from executor outputs:

Knowledge graph fragments

Signal maps

Frontier assessments

Constraint models

Opportunity surfaces

State assembly is purely additive per version.

4.2 Versioning Rules

Every successful lifecycle pass produces a new ArtifactState version

Versions are immutable

Historical versions remain queryable

5. Vectorization Pipeline (EEE)

5.1 Vector Layers

RAE maintains four orthogonal embeddings per artifact:

Semantic Vector

Structural Vector

Temporal Vector

Strategic Vector

Each layer is generated independently and versioned.

5.2 Vector Update Strategy

Minor signal updates → partial vector refresh

Major synthesis events → full vector regeneration

Drift-triggered updates → confidence downgrade until re-vectorized

6. Documentation Projection (IMPL)

Documentation generation is executed during FORMALIZE.

6.1 Projection Rules

Docs are generated from ArtifactState only

No manual authoring

Each document references ArtifactState version

6.2 Supported Outputs

Overview Snapshot

Frontier Report

Competitive Landscape

Constraint & Risk Brief

Opportunity Thesis

Strategy / Decision Memo

7. Publishing Contract (EEE)

7.1 Publish Conditions

An ArtifactState may be published if:

All required lifecycle phases complete successfully

Vectorization completed

No blocking drift flags exist

7.2 Published Interfaces

On publish, RAE exposes:

Current ArtifactState

ArtifactVectorSpace

Documentation projections

Confidence and freshness metadata

These are pushed to PIE via event + state channels.

8. Drift Detection & Monitoring

8.1 Drift Signals

Drift may be detected from:

New high-impact external signals

Internal inconsistency thresholds

Temporal decay of confidence

8.2 Drift Handling

DriftDetected event emitted

Artifact confidence downgraded

Lifecycle re-entry scheduled (DISCOVER or SYNTHESIZE)

9. Failure & Recovery Semantics

Executor failures are isolated per phase

Partial execution does not corrupt prior state

Replay is possible via event log

RAE is event-replayable by design.

10. Implementation Notes (IMPL)

10.1 Architectural Style

Event-driven

Artifact-scoped state

Append-only persistence

Deterministic executors

10.2 Scaling Model

Horizontal scaling by Artifact ID

Executors are stateless

Vector workloads may be offloaded to specialized compute

11. Strategic Importance

NS-DRE-015B operationalizes research as:

Infrastructure

Executable state

Long-lived organizational memory

This document completes the transition from research as activity to research as system.

12. Summary

RAE executes, evolves, and governs Research Artifacts through deterministic lifecycle execution, event-driven state assembly, and continuous vectorized intelligence publication to PIE.

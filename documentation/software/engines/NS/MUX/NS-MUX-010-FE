Market Integration Layer (MUX)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the frontend (FE) / operator UI specification for the Market Integration Layer (MUX).
MUX is the boundary system that captures and normalizes external truth.
The operator UI must prioritize:
connector health and isolation
ingestion visibility (webhooks/polling/batch)
integrity failures and quarantine workflows
replay and backfill controls
traceability for downstream consumers
This is a canonical UI and interaction spec, independent of any UI framework.
2. FE Design Principles
Connector Isolation Is Visible
Each connector has its own status and backlog
Truth Is Immutable
Operators may not edit raw capture or canonical artifacts
Failures Are First-Class
Signature failures, schema drift, and publish failures must be surfaced
Replays Are Governed
Replay/backfill actions require identity, reason, and governance ref where required
Evidence & Provenance Everywhere
Show source, ids, hashes, and capture lineage
3. User Personas
Integration Operator — manage connectors and ingestion
Reliability / Ops — monitor platform stability and outages
Data Steward — resolve mapping drift and quarantine review
Auditor — inspect provenance and control actions
4. Canonical Screens (MVP)
4.1 Connector Dashboard
Goal: Monitor and manage connector fleet.
Core Elements:
Connector cards list:connector_idsource_systemingestion_methodstate (enabled/degraded/disabled)last_successerror_ratebacklog (lag)rate limit hits
Key Actions (Governed as configured):
Enable / Disable connector
Pause / Resume connector
Trigger credential rotation workflow
4.2 Connector Detail
Goal: Deep visibility into a single connector.
Sections:
Config summary (version, scopes, endpoints)
Health and metrics
Recent ingestion events
Error timeline
Rate limit statistics
Actions:
Set rate limit overrides
Enter Safe Mode for this connector
4.3 Ingestion Timeline
Goal: Inspect ingestion flow across connectors.
Views:
Timeline of captures
Filters:source_systemartifact_typeoutcome (accepted/rejected/quarantined)time range
Drilldown opens Raw Capture Detail.
4.4 Raw Capture Detail
Goal: Inspect a raw inbound payload (redacted) and its validation results.
Sections:
capture_id
received_at
signature_valid result
integrity_hash
redaction markers
linked canonical artifacts (0..n)
Raw payload is viewable only with strict RBAC.
4.5 Canonical Artifact Explorer
Goal: Search and inspect canonical artifacts.
Filters:
artifact_type
source_system
external_id
occurred_at range
integrity_hash
Results show:
artifact_id
type
source
external_id
trust metadata
linked raw captures
Drilldown opens Artifact Detail.
4.6 Artifact Detail (Provenance View)
Goal: Show full lineage for a canonical artifact.
Sections:
canonical artifact fields
typed payload view (normalized)
provenance chain:raw capture(s)dedupe refsdecision artifacts
downstream publication status (topics emitted)
4.7 Quarantine Inbox
Goal: Operational queue for suspicious or blocked inputs.
Queues:
invalid signature
schema unknown
integrity mismatch
publish failures
Actions:
mark reviewed
reprocess with updated ruleset
suppress (governed)
4.8 Replay & Backfill Console (Governed)
Goal: Trigger and monitor replay/backfill jobs.
Job Types:
replay by:connectorartifact typetime windowexternal_id(s)
backfill by time window
reprocess raw capture with new ruleset
Required fields:
requester identity
reason
governance reference (if required)
Shows:
job status
progress
emitted counts
failures
4.9 Publication Status Panel
Goal: Ensure Kafka publishing is healthy.
Shows:
per-topic publish rate
publish failure count
retry queue depth
Drilldown:
failed publish attempts with artifact_id
4.10 Platform State Monitor
Goal: View platform state artifacts (outages/policy changes).
list platform_state artifacts
filter by source_system
link to connector detail
5. Component Inventory (Suggested)
ConnectorCard
ConnectorStateBadge
ConnectorMetricsMiniPanel
IngestionTimelineTable
RawCaptureCard
CanonicalArtifactTable
ArtifactProvenanceGraphPanel
DecisionArtifactList
QuarantineQueue
ReplayJobWizard
ReplayJobTable
PublishHealthPanel
GovernedActionModal (confirm + reason + governance ref)
6. Data Requirements (API Needs)
6.1 Connector Ops
list connectors + status
get connector detail + config versions
set connector state (governed)
6.2 Capture & Artifact Query
list raw captures (filtered)
get raw capture detail
list artifacts (filtered)
get artifact detail + lineage
6.3 Quarantine Ops
list quarantine items
mark reviewed
reprocess item with ruleset
6.4 Replay/Backfill
create replay job (governed)
list jobs
get job detail/status
6.5 Publication Health
topic health summary
failed publish attempt list
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Security: strict RBAC for raw payload visibility
Auditability: all operator actions logged with reason
Performance: fast filtering over artifacts
Safety: replay/backfill is governed and rate-limited

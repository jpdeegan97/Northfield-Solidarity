NSDC Engine Charter — MUX (Market Integration Layer)
1. Engine Identity
Engine Name: Market Integration Layer
Acronym: MUX
Engine Type: Integration / Connectivity
2. Mission Statement (One Sentence)
This engine exists to provide seamless, unified access and connectivity between NSDC engines and external marketplaces, APIs, and platforms, enabling standardized data exchange, order execution, and market intelligence collection.
3. Core Responsibilities (Allowed Actions)
  Connect to multiple marketplaces, APIs, and external platforms
  Standardize and normalize inbound and outbound data
  Serve as a bridge between execution engines (DAT), intelligence engines (PIE), and content engines (CDE)
  Handle authentication, API limits, throttling, and error management
  Log all integration events for audit and troubleshooting
  Provide a unified interface for other NSDC engines to interact with external markets
4. Explicit Non-Responsibilities (Forbidden Actions)
  Make decisions on trades, capital allocation, or arbitrage (DAT)
  Generate product intelligence (PIE)
  Govern compliance or risk policies (GGP)
  Publish content or manage engagement (CDE)
  Perform financial reconciliation (FLO)
MUX only facilitates connectivity and integration.

Continuous
7. Authority & Decision Rights
MUX May Decide Autonomously:
  Retry failed API calls
  Normalize data formats for internal engine consumption
  Throttle requests to comply with rate limits
MUX Must Not Decide:
  Arbitrage or trade strategies
  Governance or risk policies
  Content or market strategy decisions
MUX is purely a connectivity and translation layer.
8. Governance & Constraints
  All external interactions must comply with GGP policies
  Rate limiting, authentication, and security must be enforced
  Logging must be maintained for all external interactions
  Data integrity checks must be performed before feeding into NSDC engines
9. Failure Modes & Blast Radius
Expected Failures:
  API downtime or throttling
  Data normalization errors
  Authentication or credential errors
Worst-Case Failure:
  Execution failures due to connectivity issues
  Incomplete or corrupted data feeds
Blast Radius:
  Downstream engines like DAT, PIE, and CDE may receive incomplete or delayed data
  Does not directly impact financial correctness (FLO) or governance (GGP)
Containment strategy:
  Retry mechanisms and backoff strategies
  Fallback data pipelines
  Alerting and monitoring systems
10. Time Horizon & Optimization Target
  Optimizes for: Reliable, real-time integration and connectivity
  Time Horizon: Real-time for execution and content, near real-time for intelligence collection
11. Interfaces & Shared Primitives
  API credentials and endpoints
  Market identifiers and product IDs (PIE)
  Execution objects and order schemas (DAT)
  Content objects and channel IDs (CDE)
  Integration event logs for audit (GGP)
12. MVP Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
MVP Includes:
  Integration with 2–3 marketplaces
  Data normalization and standardization
  Execution and content deployment handling
  Logging and monitoring of API interactions
MVP Excludes:
  Predictive API failure handling beyond retries
  Full marketplace coverage beyond MVP targets
  Governance decision-making or capital allocation
13. Evolution Path (Conceptual Only)
  Phase 1: Basic connectivity and data normalization
  Phase 2: Multi-market scaling with automated error recovery
  Phase 3: Full integration across all NSDC engines with predictive throttling and optimization

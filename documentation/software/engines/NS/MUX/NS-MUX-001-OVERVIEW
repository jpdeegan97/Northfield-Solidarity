Market Integration Layer (MUX)
1. Purpose
The Market Integration Layer (MUX) is responsible for ingesting, normalizing, validating, and exposing external market and platform truth to the Northfield Solidarity ecosystem.
MUX answers a single core question:
What actually happened in the external world — according to the source of record?
MUX does not decide strategy, execute actions, or govern outcomes. It exists to provide authoritative external facts, with provenance and confidence, to internal engines.
2. Role Within Northfield Solidarity
MUX sits at the boundary between Northfield Solidarity and the outside world.
It is the system responsible for interfacing with:
Marketplaces
Ad platforms
Payment processors
Banks
Logistics providers
Data vendors
MUX supplies external truth to:
FLO — financial reconciliation and payouts
DAT — execution verification and settlement
PIE — market signals and validation
SIG — raw signal ingestion
PTE — performance attribution
GGP — audit and governance review
MUX is the only engine allowed to assert external system truth.
3. What MUX Produces
MUX produces External Artifacts, which are structured, versioned representations of external reality:
Transaction confirmations
Settlement and payout records
Statements and invoices
Delivery and fulfillment events
Platform status and availability signals
All artifacts include:
Source system
External identifiers
Timestamping
Integrity checks (hashes)
Confidence and completeness metadata
MUX outputs are non-authoritative internally until interpreted by downstream engines.
4. What MUX Does Not Do
MUX explicitly does not:
Decide how to act on external data (DAT)
Classify financial meaning (FLO)
Score or rank opportunities (PIE)
Govern policy or approvals (GGP)
Maintain internal identity or entity ownership (IDN / PECA)
MUX observes and reports.
5. Core Capabilities
Connector ManagementSecure, isolated integrations with external systems.
Normalization & ValidationConvert external schemas into canonical internal representations.
Integrity & DeduplicationPrevent duplicate or tampered data from entering the system.
Statement & Snapshot IngestionPeriodic ingestion of authoritative external snapshots.
Event EmissionEmit normalized external events to Kafka for internal consumption.
6. Trust & Provenance Model
MUX tracks trust metadata for every artifact:
Source system reliability
Transport integrity (hash verification)
Completeness (partial vs full snapshot)
Latency and staleness
Trust metadata allows downstream engines to reason about uncertainty without guessing.
7. Interaction With Other Engines



Engine

Relationship to MUX


FLO

Consumes statements, payouts, invoices


DAT

Verifies execution and settlement


PIE

Validates market reality


SIG

Receives raw signals


PTE

Consumes attribution inputs


GGP

Audits external truth lineage
MUX never bypasses governance.
8. Operational Posture
MUX is:
Write-heavy (ingestion)
Append-only for external truth
Connector-isolated (failures contained)
Replayable and auditable
External instability must not corrupt internal truth.
9. Expected Outcomes
When MUX is operating correctly:
External truth is clear and traceable
Financial reconciliation is reliable
Execution verification is grounded in reality
Audit reviews are straightforward
MUX reduces ambiguity at system boundaries.

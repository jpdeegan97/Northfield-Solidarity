Market Integration Layer (MUX)
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the canonical taxonomy for the Market Integration Layer (MUX).
The taxonomy establishes:
The atomic external artifacts MUX recognizes
How external truth is categorized and normalized
The boundary between raw external data and interpreted meaning
This taxonomy prevents downstream engines from inventing inconsistent interpretations of external reality.
2. Taxonomy Principles
External Truth FirstMUX represents what the external system asserts — not what it means internally.
Append-Only ArtifactsExternal artifacts are immutable snapshots of observed reality.
Source-Specific, Canonical ShapeRaw source formats are normalized into canonical artifact types.
No Financial or Strategic InterpretationClassification and valuation are delegated to FLO, PIE, DAT.
Provenance Is MandatoryEvery artifact must record origin, integrity, and completeness.
3. Primary Taxonomy Categories
MUX recognizes five primary classes of external artifacts:
Platform Events
Transaction & Settlement Artifacts
Statement & Snapshot Artifacts
Fulfillment & Logistics Artifacts
Platform State & Meta Artifacts
4. Platform Event Artifacts
Meaning:Discrete events emitted by an external platform.
Examples:
Ad click
Listing created
Order placed
Refund issued
Canonical Fields:
source_system
external_event_id
event_type
occurred_at
payload (raw or lightly normalized)
integrity_hash
correlation_hint (if available)
These events may be incomplete or later superseded by statements.
5. Transaction & Settlement Artifacts
Meaning:External confirmations of financial movement.
Examples:
Payment captured
Refund settled
Fee assessed
Payout initiated
Canonical Fields:
source_system
external_transaction_id
transaction_type
gross_amount
currency
occurred_at
settlement_status
integrity_hash
These artifacts represent external financial assertions, not internal ledger truth.
6. Statement & Snapshot Artifacts
Meaning:Periodic authoritative snapshots from an external system.
Examples:
Monthly bank statement
Marketplace payout report
Ad platform invoice
Canonical Fields:
source_system
statement_id
period_start / period_end
imported_at
snapshot_hash
completeness (full / partial)
Statements supersede individual events for reconciliation.
7. Fulfillment & Logistics Artifacts
Meaning:External assertions about delivery or fulfillment status.
Examples:
Shipment dispatched
Delivered
Returned
Lost
Canonical Fields:
source_system
external_fulfillment_id
fulfillment_status
occurred_at
carrier
tracking_ref
Consumed primarily by DAT and PTE.
8. Platform State & Meta Artifacts
Meaning:Signals describing the state or reliability of an external system.
Examples:
API outage
Rate limit enforced
Policy change notice
Canonical Fields:
source_system
state_type
state_value
detected_at
expected_resolution
Used for operational awareness and governance.
9. Trust & Integrity Metadata (Cross-Cutting)
Every artifact must include:
source_system
ingestion_method (api, webhook, file)
integrity_hash
completeness_flag
latency_ms
first_seen_at
last_confirmed_at
Trust metadata allows consumers to assess reliability.
10. Deduplication Semantics
Artifacts are deduplicated by:
(source_system, external_id)
integrity_hash
Duplicates are retained as references, not discarded.
11. Cross-Engine Consumption Mapping

Signal validation in PIE/SIG
Audit-ready provenance in GGP
13. Document Position in MUX Corpus
This taxonomy builds upon:

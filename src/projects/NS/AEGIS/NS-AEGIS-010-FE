NS-AEGIS-010 — FE

Project: Aegis (Dependency Management Product)

1) FE Purpose

Define the Frontend (FE) operator experience for Aegis.

Aegis FE is the human control surface for:

Registering and governing dependencies

Visualizing the dependency graph and blast radius

Managing evidence, approvals, and lifecycle

Responding to signals/incidents

The FE must remain effective as Aegis evolves from MVP → platform → standalone product.

2) UX Principles

Search-first, graph-second. Users start with “find the thing,” then explore impact.

Policy is visible. Show why a gate exists and what evidence/approvals are required.

Confidence is explicit. Declared vs observed vs inferred edges are visually distinct.

Environment-aware everywhere. Prod vs non-prod is a first-class filter.

Actionable alerts. Every signal leads to a recommended next step (CR, incident, refresh).

Low friction for low risk. Risk-tiered UX: tier_0 should feel fast.

3) MVP FE Scope

MVP FE must include:

Dependency search + detail pages

DU (scope) management and environment filtering

Change Request creation + tracking (add_dependency, update_version)

Evidence upload + status (pending/verified/expired)

Approvals view (read-only decisions; link to GGE audit ref)

Graph visualization (basic) + blast-radius results list

Signals/Incidents list + detail

Nice-to-have for MVP:

Saved views (e.g., “Tier-3 expiring evidence”)

Inline edge editing (declared edges)

4) Information Architecture (Navigation)

Primary Nav

Dashboard

Dependencies

Graph

Change Requests

Evidence

Signals / Incidents

Policies (read-only in Aegis; source-of-truth is GGE)

Connectors (read-only health + coverage)

Global Controls

Environment selector: All / dev / uat / prod

System boundary selector (engine/project/service)

Confidence selector: observed / declared / inferred

Time window selector (for observed edges): e.g., last seen in 7/30/90 days

5) Screen Specifications

5.1 Dashboard

Purpose: immediate posture overview.

Key tiles (MVP):

Dependencies by state (Active/Constrained/Deprecated)

Tier-3 coverage (owners assigned, evidence fresh)

Evidence expiring soon (30/60/90 days)

Open incidents / high severity signals

Drift alerts count (if enabled)

Primary actions:

“Add dependency” (opens CR wizard)

“Create update CR”

5.2 Dependencies List

Search + filters:

Text search (name/id/alias)

Class/subclass

Lifecycle status

Risk tier

Owner

Evidence state (missing/expired)

Row fields:

Name, class, risk tier, status, owner, last verified, evidence health

5.3 Dependency Detail

Sections:

Header: name, canonical ID, class/subclass, status, risk tier, owner

Scope (DUs): table grouped by environment/region/boundary

Evidence: required vs present, verification status, expiry

Graph: upstream/downstream panels with counts

Activity: CR history + signal history + observations

Primary actions:

“Request change” → creates CR

“Add scope (DU)” → creates CR (add_environment_scope)

“Deprecate / Replace” → creates CR (deprecate_dependency / replace_dependency)

5.4 DU (Dependency Unit) Detail

Purpose: environment-scoped posture.

Fields:

env/region/boundary

constraints (data sent, endpoints, rate limits, allowed services)

last observed

DU-level evidence

Actions:

“Constrain” (exception CR)

“Request renewal” (renew_vendor CR)

5.5 Graph View

Modes:

Explore: start from a node and expand 1–3 hops

Impact: enter a dependency, compute downstream blast radius

Controls:

hop count

environment filter

confidence filter

edge type filter

Visual encoding:

Node type icons (software/vendor/infra/data)

Edge style indicates confidence (observed solid, declared dashed, inferred dotted)

Severity overlay for nodes affected by active signals

MVP output: graph canvas + a results table of affected assets.

5.6 Change Requests (CR) List

Filters:

status

type

risk tier

requested by

updated within

CR card/row:

CR ID, type, subject, status, current gate (evidence/approvals), timestamps

5.7 CR Detail

Sections:

Summary + justification

Diff (before/after) with human-friendly render

Policy decision:

required evidence

approval chain

constraints

policy set/version

Approvals timeline (read-only; link out to GGE)

Evidence checklist (upload + status)

Commit log (when registry/graph changed)

Actions:

Upload evidence

Withdraw (if draft/submitted)

5.8 Evidence Library

Views:

By dependency/DU

Expiring soon

Missing required evidence (derived by policy)

Evidence detail:

type, revision, hash, verification status, verified_at, expires_at, source

5.9 Signals / Incidents

Signals list:

severity, type, status, mapped subject, received time

Incident detail:

impacted graph results

assigned owner/on-call

remediation plan (from CWP)

state transitions

closure evidence + snapshot ref

5.10 Policies (Read-only)

Aegis should display (not author) the policies sourced from GGE:

risk tier definitions

evidence baselines

approval baselines

exception limits

5.11 Connectors (Read-only)

Show ingestion posture:

connectors online/offline

last event time

coverage summary (how many dependencies have observed edges)

contract versions

6) CR Wizard (MVP: Add Dependency)

A guided flow that reduces friction.

Steps:

Classify: software/vendor/infra/data + subclass

Scope: environment + boundary + region

Risk Inputs: criticality + data sensitivity + exposure hints

Policy Preview: show derived risk tier, required evidence, approval chain (from GGE)

Evidence Upload (optional now; required before approvals complete)

Submit

7) Component Library (Reusable)

EntityCard (dependency/DU/service)

RiskBadge (tier + criticality)

EvidenceChecklist (required vs present)

ApprovalTimeline

DiffViewer (structured JSON diff + friendly view)

GraphMiniPanel (up/downstream counts)

SignalBanner (active alerts)

EnvironmentFilterBar (global)

8) Permissions Model (FE Behavior)

FE must enforce and reflect authz:

Operators can draft/submit CRs in allowed boundaries

Approvers can view CRs and approval state; approvals happen in GGE (or via embedded GGE surface)

Security/compliance can view evidence and signals broadly

Evidence access is restricted by boundary + risk tier + sensitivity

UI behavior:

If user lacks access, hide actions but allow partial read views where permitted.

9) FE Telemetry

Track:

search usage and time-to-find dependency

CR funnel drop-offs (where friction occurs)

most common evidence missing types

graph query usage (impact vs explore)

10) Evolution Path (FE)

MVP

Core pages + basic graph + CR wizard + evidence upload

V1

Saved views, richer graph overlays, snapshot diffs in UI, connector coverage panels

V2

Predictive posture dashboards, migration portfolio tracking, standardization recommendations UI

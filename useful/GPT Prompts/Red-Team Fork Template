🔴 Red-Team Fork Template

(Adversarial Stress Test — v1.0)

Use this template to actively try to break an idea, design, or decision.
This fork assumes the role of a hostile environment, not a collaborator.

Fork Header

Fork Name: RT-<short name>

Target Artifact: <idea / design / assumption / plan>

Based on Snapshot: <canonical snapshot version or none>

Red-Team Goal:
What failure are we trying to surface?
(e.g., hidden assumptions, fragility, over-complexity, false confidence)

Attack Posture

Select one or more:

☐ Logical inconsistency

☐ Hidden assumptions

☐ Edge-case failure

☐ Human misuse / misunderstanding

☐ Operational brittleness

☐ Scaling collapse

☐ Reversibility failure

☐ Cognitive bias exploitation

☐ Over-engineering / under-engineering

Canonical Claims Under Attack

List claims as assertions, not descriptions.

C1: <assertion>

C2: <assertion>

C3: <assertion>

If a claim cannot be stated crisply, it is already suspect.

Adversarial Scenarios

For each claim, attempt to force failure.

Scenario A

Trigger: <what changes or goes wrong>

Failure Mode: <how the system breaks>

Why This Was Missed: <bias, assumption, blind spot>

Scenario B

Trigger: …

Failure Mode: …

Why This Was Missed: …

Assumption Extraction

List unstated assumptions the system relies on.

A1: This assumes that <thing> will always be true

A2: This assumes that <actor> behaves rationally

A3: This assumes that <constraint> never tightens

Mark each:

☐ Explicit

☐ Implicit

☐ Wishful

Reversibility Test

Answer honestly:

Can this be undone without damage?

What is the cost of rollback?

What becomes harder after committing?

If rollback requires heroics → fail.

Simplification Attack

What can be removed without losing the core benefit?

What exists only to support another fragile component?

Is this solving a real problem or an anticipated one?

Abuse & Misuse Cases

Assume:

Users misunderstand

You forget context

Future-you is rushed or tired

How does this break?

Outcome Classification

Choose one:

✅ Survives intact

🟡 Survives with constraints

🔧 Requires redesign

❌ Fundamentally flawed

Required Changes (If Any)

<change 1>

<change 2>

Red-Team Verdict

One paragraph. No hedging.

“This fails because…”
or
“This survives because…”

Merge Guidance

☐ Do not merge

☐ Merge as cautionary notes

☐ Merge with changes

☐ Promote redesigned version

Assistant Instruction

Be adversarial, not polite.
Prefer uncomfortable truths over elegance.
Assume optimism is a bug.

🧠 When to Use This

Before committing to architecture

Before adding complexity

When something feels “too clean”

When confidence is high but evidence is thin

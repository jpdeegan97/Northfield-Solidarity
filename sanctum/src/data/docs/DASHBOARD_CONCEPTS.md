# Sanctum Dashboard Concepts

Ten conceptual directions for the evolution of the Sanctum Dashboard (`/`). These designs aim to transform the dashboard from a simple navigational menu into a high-density "Heads-Up Display" (HUD) for situational awareness.

## 1. The "Daily Briefing" / Command Deck

Turn the dashboard into a **Pre-Flight Checklist** for your day.

* **The Hook:** "What is required of me today?"
* **Features:**
  * **Chronicle Integration:** Displays yesterday's closing "State of Mind" and today's "Primary Intent."
  * **Pending Approvals:** A queue of high-priority decisions (Mock GGP permissions, MINT formations awaiting signature).
  * **Critical Alerts:** A filtered list of red-flag events from the CWP (e.g., "Asset Scraper Failed," "SSL Expiry").

## 2. The "Financial Fortress" HUD

A dedicated, high-fidelity financial control center.

* **The Hook:** "Show me the money and the targets."
* **Features:**
  * **Live Net Worth:** Aggregated real-time balances (Crypto + Fiat + Equity).
  * **Target vs. Reality:** A visual burn-down chart comparing your current liquidity against the **Total Target Value** from the "Dreams" engine (e.g., *Current: $2.4M / Target: $184M*).
  * **Cashflow Velocity:** Gauges showing burn rate vs. income rate across all projects.

## 3. The "Entity Topology" (MINT Surface)

A visual web of your legal and corporate empire.

* **The Hook:** "Who owns what?"
* **Features:**
  * **Interactive Graph:** A 2D force-directed graph showing the parent-child relationships between *Northfield Solidarity*, *South Lawn*, and the *LLCs* created in MINT.
  * **Compliance Heatmap:** Color-code entities based on their standing (Good Standing = Green, Franchise Tax Due = Yellow).

## 4. The "Signal Intelligence" Room (SIG Engine)

A trading-desk style interface for incoming data streams.

* **The Hook:** "What is the world doing?"
* **Features:**
  * **Market Feeds:** Tickers for relevant asset classes (Real Estate Indexes, Crypto, Competitor Stock).
  * **Active Scrapes:** Live terminal output from your **CWP Crawlers** showing assets being discovered in real-time.
  * **Pattern Recognition:** A "Trending Topic" cloud generated from your journal entries and research.

## 5. The "Engineering Stack" Topology

A blueprint view of your software ecosystem.

* **The Hook:** "Is the machine healthy?"
* **Features:**
  * **Layered Cake View:** Visual layers for *Infrastructure*, *Data*, *Engines*, and *Interfaces*.
  * **Engine Health Matrix:** A grid of all registered engines (GGP, FLO, DAT, MINT) blinking with their real-time heartbeat status.
  * **Build Status:** Recent commits and deployment status for the Sanctum codebase itself.

## 6. The "War Room" Map (Geospatial)

A 2D global map focusing on physical presence.

* **The Hook:** "Where are we physically?"
* **Features:**
  * **Asset Locations:** Pins for every physical asset in "Dreams" (e.g., 432 Park Ave, The Exumas) and active real estate (South Lawn).
  * **Server Nodes:** Locations of your digital infrastructure.
  * **Personnel Tracker:** A global view of the "Active Personnel" (from your sidebar widget) plotted on the map.

## 7. The "Manifold Tracer" Productivity Meter

A gamified, quantified-self view of your output.

* **The Hook:** "Am I in Flow?"
* **Features:**
  * **Flow State Gauge:** A visual meter that fills up based on your activity (lines of code, journal entries, tasks closed).
  * **Session Timer:** A deep-work timer that tracks "Focus Blocks" achieved today.
  * **Output Velocity:** A graph showing your creative output over the last 7 days.

## 8. The "Governance" Console (GGP Focus)

A presidential view of rules, laws, and access.

* **The Hook:** "Who has the keys?"
* **Features:**
  * **Access Log Stream:** A live matrix rain of every successful/failed login attempt (like the sidebar widget but expanded).
  * **Role Hierarchy:** A visual pyramid of active roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer).
  * **Policy Editor:** Quick access to change system-wide DEFCON levels or security protocols.

## 9. The "Dream Vault" (Visual Motivation)

A pure aesthetic 'Art Gallery' mode.

* **The Hook:** "Eyes on the prize."
* **Features:**
  * **Cover Flow:** A cinematic, auto-rotating carousel of your highest-value targets (The Bugatti, The Penthouse).
  * **Motivation Mode:** No data, no text—just high-res imagery and ambient soundscapes to center your mind before work.

## 10. The "System Pulse" / KPI Grid

A 'Bloomberg Terminal' for your life and business.

* **The Hook:** "Just the numbers."
* **Features:**
  * **Modular Grid:** Customizable 4x4 grid of widgets.
  * **Widgets:** Server Uptime, Bank Balance, Unread Emails, Next Calendar Event, Daily Stock Price, System Load.
  * **Dense Data:** Minimalist, high-contrast text, maximum information density.
